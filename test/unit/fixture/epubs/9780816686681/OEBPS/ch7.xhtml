		<h2>7 <span class="italic">LOCAS, PAPIS, </span>AND MUSCLE QUEENS</h2>
		<h4>Racialized Discourses of Masculinity and Desire</h4>
		
		<p>LUIS WAS A MASCULINE-IDENTIFIED, twenty-seven-year-old Cuban American gay man who grew up in South Beach in the 1970s and 1980s. Even though from early childhood he was aware of his own sexuality and engaged in sexual play with other boys, Luis did not begin to understand himself as gay until he was a high school student. However, even during childhood, he felt that the expectations of masculine performance were being imposed on him. Raised by a single mother, Luis indicated that even before he was born, his mother&#x2019;s friends worried about the absence of a father figure and warned her to raise him right so that he would not be a sissy. He recalled being teased by the other Cuban American kids who rode a private school bus with him. Although they did not know he liked boys, they accused him of being a &#x201C;sissy&#x201D; and a &#x201C;fag.&#x201D; Early on, he understood that he was being teased for failing at masculine performance: &#x201C;I was picked on for being effeminate perhaps but not for liking other boys, you know. Who knows if those other boys were doing things, but that wasn&#x2019;t, like, really an issue.&#x201D; Through explicit warnings and teasing, Luis&#x2019;s schoolmates, his mother, and his mother&#x2019;s friends all taught him appropriate male behavior. Nevertheless, he consistently failed to fulfill these expectations.</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>I remember . . . me, like, maybe not being the most masculine little boy. I wanted ballet lessons at three. I wanted to be a ballet dancer which, probably, like you know, made my mom want to kill herself, for me to openly say that around people or whatever. . . . I remember specifically at some age being . . . told how to hold my wrists because I guess I was letting them hang in some stereotypical limp-wristed gay way. And years later when I asked my mom why I had never had piano lessons or if she had ever considered giving me [lessons], she said she had but that somebody had made a comment about . . . her son turning out to be like Liberace, so she didn&#x2019;t.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Luis&#x2019;s lack of athletic inclinations, his desire to learn how to play the piano, and his body language marked him as nonmasculine and further taught him the difference between masculine and effeminate behavior. These challenges to his boyhood masculinity remained complexly linked to his identity as gay and to his sexual relationships with members of the same sex. Whereas the taunts of sissy and fag and the warnings about turning into Liberace all conflated effeminacy and homosexuality, Luis maintained that his gender transgressions&#x2014;not his sexual activities&#x2014;marked him for ridicule and reprimands.</p>
		<p>At the time of our interview, Luis lived an openly gay life in South Beach, residing a few blocks away from the apartment building where his mother had denied him piano training. Although at one point in our interview he had stated, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m overtly masculine,&#x201D; throughout the majority of the interview he clearly contrasted himself with effeminate gay men and described himself as masculine. He affirmed that he does &#x201C;not wear [his] effeminacy&#x201D; and that this has kept him physically safe from perpetrators of gay bashing.</p>
		<p>One-third of the residents of Luis&#x2019;s building were also gay men, reflecting the demographic makeup of South Beach at the time. Luis complained about the homogeneousness of the gay South Beach scene in the 1990s. Though he felt he did not meet the &#x201C;South Beach standards of the shaved gym-built body,&#x201D; he also explained that he was not particularly attracted to that physique or style. At the turn of the millennium, &#x201C;South Beach standards&#x201D; for gay men&#x2019;s appearance prevailed throughout the pedestrian malls, clubs, and gyms concentrated within a few miles of Luis&#x2019;s home. Against this standard, Luis viewed his own physique as inadequate. At the time of our interviews, a new gym was being constructed on Luis&#x2019;s block. The three-story structure owned by a national chain charged nearly $700 a year for the use of its facilities when it opened in 2001, much more than someone with Luis&#x2019;s salary could reasonably afford.</p>
		<p>Luis&#x2019;s personal history highlights the different discourses of masculinity second-generation Cuban American gay men may confront as they grow up. Like Luis, many Cuban American gay men navigate their adult sexuality in the wake of powerful boyhood messages about the relationship between sexuality and masculinity. As discussed in chapter 4, the Latin American sex system theorized by Tom&#225;s Almaguer emphasizes active and passive sexual roles and their relation to gender performance. This conceptual framework explains some of the lessons in masculinity transmitted through child-rearing practices, family messages, and childhood experiences.<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> However, the Latin American sex system does not provide the only definition of masculinity that Cuban American gay men negotiate. Cuban American gay men in Miami live in a transcultural gay culture where they are socialized into, interact with, draw from, and resist several sex-gender systems. Specifically, Cuban American gay men grapple with what I call the <span class="italic">papi </span>discourse of masculinity that defines Latino men, or hot Latin boys, as virile, hypermasculine objects of gay desire. The <span class="italic">papi </span>discourse draws on racialized assumptions that depict Latino male urban youth as street-tough and somewhat dangerous even as it eroticizes this danger and makes it safe. In this chapter, I foreground how informants felt alienated by this discourse even as they simultaneously and consciously reenacted its racial and gender markers. Cuban American gay men also position themselves in relation to a hypermasculine ideal of gay Anglo masculinity (an ideal especially prominent in the circuit party scene during the 1990s), what Luis referred to as &#x201C;South Beach standards of the shaved gym-built body.&#x201D; I maintain that Cuban American gay men, who are often ambiguously situated in Miami&#x2019;s racial hierarchy, also worked within this discourse even as they felt distanced from it. I examine the ways in which Cuban American gay men navigated these three discourses of masculinity. Throughout the chapter, I return to Luis&#x2019;s story and use his complicated relationship to masculinity to highlight the sacrifices and payoffs that these (sometimes competing) discourses of masculinity provide in the realms of family, desire, and men&#x2019;s sense of self-worth.</p>
		<p>I examine masculinity in terms of how men self-identify in terms of gender. How do informants describe themselves as gendered beings? How do they describe the development of gender identities, and how does gender identity relate to their personal history of sexual practices? I also examine social expectations about proper masculine behavior. How do Cuban American gay men believe others (their family, friends, coworkers, neighbors) expect them to behave? Via what tangible and intangible channels are these expectations communicated to Cuban American gay men? In what ways do these expectations imply a value-laden hierarchy about what constitutes appropriate behavior for young boys and adult men? I examine the social power of masculinity. What are the benefits gained from a successful performance of masculinity? These might include services and social acceptance provided by family members, a sense of safety, or acceptance in neighborhood and work settings. Finally, I examine the relationship between masculinity and sex. How is gender related to sexual practices? In what ways does masculinity play into men&#x2019;s desires, and how do Cuban American gay men present themselves as desirable to others?</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Locas </span>and Machos: A Latin American Typology</h3>
		<p>Most of the Cuban American gay men I interviewed for this study strongly identified as masculine and explicitly distanced themselves from effeminacy. Although the effeminate, broadly construed, was clearly important in articulating Cuban American gay male culture in sites such as drag performances and gay Latino magazines, in men&#x2019;s stories about themselves effeminacy was nearly always constructed as a source of anxiety. Moreover, Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s masculine self-descriptions commonly took on the form of an insistent claim. For example, one respondent stressed: &#x201C;I was always a man. I was always very masculine in my way of being. I didn&#x2019;t have feminine things. I think everybody does have feminine things about them, but I was never a queen or a feminine person.&#x201D; Such adamant reiterations of masculinity can be seen as a response to the assumption that gay men are effeminate and not masculine.</p>
		<p>Almaguer&#x2019;s discussion of the Latin American sex system helps illuminate this investment in masculinity and concomitant anxiety about effeminacy. According to Almaguer, Latin American men taking the passive sexual role are most highly stigmatized, and these <span class="italic">pasivos </span>are assumed to be effeminate. On the other hand, <span class="italic">activos, </span>men who have sex with men but take the penetrating role are less stigmatized and believed to have a masculine appearance. The reverse also holds true in this typology: that is, those with masculine appearances are believed to be real men, whereas those with a gender-transgressive appearance are assumed to be <span class="italic">pasivos. </span>In summary, in the Latin American sex system, outward gender markers, sexual roles, and social power are highly conflated.</p>
		<p>Marvin Leiner describes the enactment of a similar system of sexual and gender meanings in Cuba:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>To have sex with another man is not what identifies one as homosexual. For many Cubans, a man is homosexual only if he takes the passive receiving role. And a man is suspected of being homosexual only if his behavior is not macho: if he does not show interest in rough games, or is not physically strong and muscular; if he is gentle or quiet or perhaps has a nurturing sensibility to other people&#x2019;s feelings; if he does not care to control others or to posture and aggressively compete with his fellows.<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>As Leiner indicates, while discussions of the Latin American sex system often emphasize sex roles, outward gender markers are socially interpreted. In my estimation, the importance of gender roles lies not so much in their correspondence with sexual position, for nuanced accounts indicate that in actual sexual situations many men often desire the opposite of what their outward gender signs might suggest.<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> Rather, the importance of gender markers resides in how they mark or mask sexual difference to others. As Ian Lumsden asserts in his account of Havana in the 1990s:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>If you behave &#x201C;normally,&#x201D; other Cubans will assume that you are basically heterosexual even if you have been known to have had sex with another man. . . . The Cuban equivalent to coming out as a gay person in North America is to refuse to conform to traditional male mannerisms in public, knowing that such behavior will be perceived as &#x201C;effeminate,&#x201D; as unbecoming a &#x201C;real man.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>In other words, a convincing performance of normal masculinity through outward gender markers ensures social acceptance. The real social transgression is to embrace what is seen as feminine.</p>
		<p>The discourse of masculinity embedded in the Latin American sex system intersects with Miami&#x2019;s particular gay history. As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, the hypervisible Mariel gay population was highly stigmatized. Central to this generation&#x2019;s marginalization was not only the gender transgression associated with passive homosexuality in the Latin American sex system but also assumptions about lower-class backgrounds and recent immigrant status. This intersection is most striking in my respondents&#x2019; self-distancing from the figure of the <span class="italic">loca </span>or the disparaged combination of outward effeminacy and presumed <span class="italic">pasivo </span>sexual position within the taxonomy of the Latin American sex system. In this regard, Mart&#xED;n, a light-skinned, Miami-born Cuban American in his late thirties, described his views about effeminacy quite directly.</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">MARTIN: I don&#x2019;t necessarily hide being gay, but I don&#x2019;t want to be the stereotype of the horrible gay Cuban queen.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: Which is what?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">M: Which is awful. It&#x2019;s awful. You&#x2019;ll know it when you see it. I guess in their worst form, I find them overtly effeminate. I find them inclined to put on airs of grandeur where none exists, I think. I find them uneducated. . . . I think they&#x2019;re low class. They tend to be very vicious. . . . I can&#x2019;t really relate to them because I just find that they have a whole world of their own, and they remind me to an extent of women.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>In Mart&#xED;n&#x2019;s account, gender, ethnic, and class markers combine to represent the most feared, disliked, and stigmatized figure in the Latin American sex system. Mart&#xED;n&#x2019;s &#x201C;horrible gay Cuban queen&#x201D; bears the stigma of an effeminacy branded as particularly or inherently Cuban. These class-marked &#x201C;horrible,&#x201D; &#x201C;uneducated,&#x201D; &#x201C;low-class&#x201D; Cuban queens have nothing to do with the world of U.S.-born, professional, masculine-identified men with whom Mart&#xED;n socializes&#x2014;men who might choose to camp it up when in gay company but who are proud of their achieved masculinity. For Mart&#xED;n, the feminine/pasivo/loca in the Latin American sex typology represents the type of person he does not want to be: &#x201C;They remind [him] to an extent of women.&#x201D; His account demonstrates the effects of a fear of the conflation of homosexuality with femininity and/or femaleness as outlined in the Latin American sex system. I would also argue that the &#x201C;horrible gay Cuban queen&#x201D; Mart&#xED;n identifies is strongly associated with the widely stigmatized culture of gay men who came from Cuba to the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift, for the combination of ostentation, effeminacy, perceived ignorance, and low-class status negatively marked the gay Mariel migration.</p>
		<p>When I pushed Mart&#xED;n further about his feelings toward masculinity and effeminacy, he again interwove gender with class position:</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">MARTIN: It comes down to a certain definition of masculinity, and I don&#x2019;t see that in some particular Cuban gay men especially, but I guess it also depends on education, class and background. . . . I&#x2019;ve never been into that aspect, you know like the drag aspect. I guess it comes down to the fear of being effeminate or too effeminate.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: So what is being a man to you? What is your idea of masculinity?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">M: Well I never really thought about that, but I guess there&#x2019;s still a part of me that still holds on to the traditional notions, what your dad always taught you, <span class="italic">ser hombre </span>[be a man]. . . . And I guess I never thought about that before, but I guess some of that has stuck into me.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Mart&#xED;n implied that his own class position as a professional and the son of two upper-middle-class parents may have informed why he has never &#x201C;been into . . . the drag aspect&#x201D; of gay life. In addition, he implied that drag queens and effeminate men are less educated and come from lower-class backgrounds. Mart&#xED;n&#x2019;s presumptions are supported by a range of studies throughout Latin America and the United States that suggest that gendered <span class="italic">pasivo/activo </span>divisions among men who have sex with men are more highly entrenched within working-class populations.<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>
		<p>Another key aspect of Mart&#xED;n&#x2019;s tying class position to gender appearance deals with passing and being targeted as gay. Because gender-transgressive men are more likely targets of discrimination, looking masculine (or, some might say, passing as straight) provides greater access to jobs. In addition, other interviewees believed a masculine appearance made them less likely to be targets of violence. When I interviewed Luis, he noted that his masculine appearance and his size were probably responsible for the fact that, in adulthood, he never felt physically threatened because of his sexuality.</p>
		<p>The masculine-identified Mart&#xED;n further discussed learning how to &#x201C;ser hombre,&#x201D; or be a man, from his father, and Luis remembered being taught by his mother how not to be effeminate. Both examples illustrate how the men I interviewed learned about masculinity and made use of these lessons in masculinity to navigate adult relationships with families. As discussed in chapter 6, maintaining relationships and regular contact with biological family is important to many Cuban American gay men across age, migration, and language divides. Family is the site where many Cuban American gay men negotiate their relationships to Cuban culture; thus, the men in my sample prioritized maintaining relationships with biological family in ways that included regular face-to-face interactions. Most also participated in gay social settings and same-sex relationships. The Latin American sex system proves useful in interpreting how these men balanced participation in family and participation in gay social circles. Commonly, they drew from the assumptions of the Latin American sex system&#x2014;that is, that a homosexual man will look effeminate and that a masculine-looking man cannot be gay&#x2014;to maintain their participation in family and gay spheres. Because effeminacy is equated with male homosexuality, outward masculine markers effectively support presumed heterosexuality. Therefore, these Cuban American gay men routinely assumed that a masculine appearance eased relationships with family members and the Cuban community in general.</p>
		<p>For example, Miguel, a respondent in his midthirties who came to the United States when he was very young, explained why his parents fully accepted his boyfriend. Miguel and his parents had been sharing a house when his boyfriend started living with him. According to Miguel, his parents accepted his boyfriend because they both looked masculine and would, therefore, not raise suspicions in the neighborhood. Miguel explained the relationship between sexual practice, gender appearance, and community approval:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>It&#x2019;s not so much with what that person does in bed because maybe that guy will flip over. It&#x2019;s the way he behaves . . . the way he talks is masculine, and he doesn&#x2019;t have a feather on him . . . so immediately the community accepts him as being part of the community even though people might know that he&#x2019;s with another man.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Miguel clearly references the Latin American sex system&#x2019;s understanding of sexual position when he discusses how a guy will &#x201C;flip over.&#x201D; Flipping over refers to a man who looks masculine and, therefore, is assumed to want to penetrate but who actually desires to be penetrated. The phrase can also refer to a feminine-looking man who will want to penetrate. Flipping over, therefore, makes reference to the assumed correspondence between gender appearance and sexual position while pointing to how the system is undermined in real sexual situations.</p>
		<p>Miguel&#x2019;s comments draw attention to the relative importance of gender markers as compared with sexual practices. He referred to a man&#x2019;s choice to behave and speak in an ostensibly masculine way. He suggested that someone who &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t have a feather on him&#x201D; can have access to community acceptance. This reference to feathers derives from the Spanish word <span class="italic">p&#225;jaro, </span>which literally means &#x201C;bird&#x201D; but is also used to connote male homosexuality. Here the presence of feathers implies effeminate behavior.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> Therefore, &#x201C;not having a feather on you&#x201D; or appearing unquestionably masculine ensures acceptance in nongay settings. Miguel concisely identified how he employed elements of this meaning system to navigate family and community acceptance. Although he cohabitated with his boyfriend, Miguel bypassed questions about his sexuality and ensured community acceptance by maintaining a masculine appearance.</p>
		<p>Because gay men explicitly recognize the consequences of being effeminate, we can understand their deployment of masculinity as strategic. Mart&#xED;n knew that he could not maintain his social-economic position as a professional if he were gender transgressive. Similarly, Miguel believed that he and his boyfriend would not be embraced by his family or accepted by his residential community if either one of them appeared effeminate. Thus Miguel and Mart&#xED;n both consciously evaluated their gender appearances in order to maintain their familial and professional relationships.</p>
		<p>Clearly, many elements of the Latin American sex system help explain Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s gender identities, gender strategies, and gender fears. This framework highlights how stigmatized gender and class markers are collapsed. In addition, it draws attention to how Cuban American gay men negotiate their gender and sexual identities with biological family. However, although this typology helps interpret the specific meanings that Cuban American gay men attribute to masculinity, ethnographic accounts of the Latin American sex system are not sufficient to understand the lives of U.S. Latinos. First of all, by collapsing all of Latin America into one cultural system, we homogenize a diverse group of cultures widely differentiated by nationality, race, language, and class divisions. Not all Latin American countries share the same political and social understanding of male homosexuality. Therefore a typology that assumes that all Latin American cultures understand sex/gender in the same way is limited at best. Moreover, several scholars have noted the diversity of sexual systems that exist within different Latin American regions and nations and the extent to which the typology of a sex system, assumed to be self-contained and distinct from other sexual systems, does not fully capture the reality of sexual practices, sexual meanings, and sexual identities in a trans-cultural world. Various studies note that globalization&#x2019;s effects have made it difficult to discuss the Latin American sexual system and the U.S. sexual system as completely distinct and independent systems. In fact, researchers in Latin American countries have noted the extent to which middle-class Latin American men in urban centers are increasingly identifying as gay and understanding sexuality in terms of sexual object choice instead of sexual aim, in part because of the increased personal and cultural contact between Latin America and the United States. Processes of gay globalization make it more likely for Anglo gay men from the United States to vacation in Havana, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro and for men in Cuba, Mexico, and Brazil to watch movies, read articles, and gather information about U.S. gay urban cultures. Likewise, through its attempts to replicate successful U.S. programs to reduce male-to-male sexual transmission of HIV in Latin America, the globalized AIDS industry has reinforced U.S. gay categories in the region. Therefore information about U.S. gay cultures, with the concomitant international economic power and social influence of the United States, is increasingly influential throughout Latin America, especially in urban centers.<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Just as we cannot accept accounts of a singular or unitary Latin America, we also cannot pretend that Latin American sex and gender systems are easily or unproblematically transplanted to the United States. Latino gay men encounter several competing gender and sexual discourses. It would be wrong to think that a discourse that equates homosexuality with effeminacy is the only or even the dominant system gay men are confronted with as they develop their sexual lives. In Miami alone, various discourses equate Latino males with an erotic toughness and equate male homosexuality with masculine, strong-looking men. In Miami, <span class="italic">locas </span>are one stereotype of homosexuality, but discourses of <span class="italic">papis </span>and &#x201C;muscle boys&#x201D; are becoming more commonly associated with gay images. In an effort not to conflate Latin American and U.S. Latino lives, we must, therefore, begin to discuss other powerful frameworks that structure gay Latinos&#x2019; lives in the United States.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Papis </span>or Hot Latin Boys: Latino Masculinity</h3>
		<p>Another powerful discourse that structures Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s lives is what I call the <span class="italic">papi </span>discourse. This discourse imagines Latino men as masculine objects of desire. Literally, <span class="italic">papi </span>means daddy. That being said, when not referring to one&#x2019;s actual father, the term <span class="italic">papi </span>takes on a sexualized valence that indicates carnal intimacy in the Latin American vernacular&#x2014;particularly in the Hispanophone Caribbean. Similar to the way baby can be used in English, <span class="italic">papi </span>can be used informally to suggest familiarity, but variations in intonation or setting can convey a more suggestive, sexualized meaning. In the Cuban American gay vernacular, <span class="italic">papi </span>is an affectionate term used by gay men to refer to a masculine, attractive man. <span class="italic">Papis </span>are young, masculine, attractive, &#x201C;Latino looking&#x201D; (between white and black), and usually underdressed. They have a prominent but not overwhelming musculature.</p>
		<p>Steven Kurtz has found that U.S. gay culture frequently superimposes these stereotypes of Latino machismo and sexual prowess onto Cuban American and Puerto Rican men in South Florida:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Having come to despise the <span class="italic">mariposa </span>they once feared themselves to be, the hypermasculinity of Miami&#x2019;s gay life provided them with an opportunity to perform the machismo they were unable to achieve inside of their ethnic cultural spaces. At the same time, even after coming out as gay men, they found themselves as self-conscious as ever about their ultimate failure to achieve macho sexuality. Their new gay identities gave them no more freedom to express or act upon their desire to be penetrated by other men.<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Like <span class="italic">p&#225;jaro </span>and <span class="italic">loca, mariposa </span>(butterfly) is yet another common term within the Cuban vernacular used to refer to effeminate homosexual men. Kurtz argues that while the derogatory stereotype of the effeminate <span class="italic">loca/p&#225;jaro/mariposa </span>limited the identificatory, sexual, and social possibilities of Cuban American gay men, the stereotype of the masculine penetrating macho also limited what desires they could enact.</p>
		<p>Gendered and racialized portrayals of Latino men as <span class="italic">papis </span>circulate in the dominant media, the social sciences, and the gay media. The <span class="italic">papi </span>discourse borrows from U.S. popular culture representations of the figure of the Latin lover. This common depiction of Latino (hetero) masculinity combines the characteristics of &#x201C;eroticism, exoticism, tenderness tinged with violence and danger, all adding up to the romantic promise that, sexually, things could get out of control.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> The danger and allure of the Latin lover are related to stereotypical historical depictions of a hypersexual and uncontrolled temperament characteristic of Latin Americans, especially those of Caribbean descent. These depictions, in turn, are related to understandings of uncontrollable and virile black sexuality. However, representations of the Latin lover are usually distinguishable from those of black men. First, Latin lovers are always phenotypically depicted as brown-skinned, that is, somewhere between black and white. Second, they are portrayed as only slightly dangerous (as a way to expand their exotic appeal); thus they pose less of a threat than black males. The <span class="italic">papi </span>discourse also draws on contemporary mass media representations of Latino male youth as dangerous causes of urban social problems. The racialized tough-youth threat softened by Latin lover allure creates a powerful erotic combination.</p>
		<p>Social science discourse on Latino masculinity resonates and intersects with these popular representations. In particular, social scientists have uncritically used the term <span class="italic">machismo </span>as a cultural concept equating patriarchy with Latin America. In his study of masculinities among Mexican working-class men, Matthew Gutmann describes &#x201C;anthropology&#x2019;s affinity to the Mexican macho.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> Many ethnographies tend to associate virility, sexual conquest, procreation, bragging, and defying death with Mexican machos. According to Gutmann, Mexican men are used as a</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>foil against which other men less concerned with virility are compared. . . . Macho and machismo have become a form of calumny, shorthand terms in social science and journalistic writing for labeling a host of negative male characteristics in cultures around the world.<sup><a id="footnote_back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>In this way, machismo and the accompanying notion of the macho become answers rather than questions. In addition, the Mexican macho becomes the negatively valued other against which U.S. social scientists evaluate Anglo U.S. masculinities. Maxine Baca Zinn argues that this tendency to treat machismo as a cultural inheritance from Latin America has been transposed onto analyses of gender relations among Latino populations living in the United States. Chicano men are portrayed as participating in a &#x201C;rigid cult of masculinity&#x201D; that involves behaviors including excessive drinking, excessive bravado in fights to prove manhood, the unquestioned power of the father-figure within the family structure, and an uncontrollable virility that leads to extramarital relations.<sup><a id="footnote_back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></p>
		<p>Social critics such as Baca Zinn, Lionel Cant&#xfa; Jr., and Alfredo Mirand&#xE9; have challenged the homogenized concept of machismo from different perspectives. They suggest that when analyzing masculine power within a Latino context, social scientists should take into account the structural position of the men under analysis and the relationship between this structural position and their expressions of masculinity.<sup><a id="footnote_back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> Here I focus on how the discourse that equates machismo, Latino men, unbridled masculinity, virile sexuality, and sensuality structures how Cuban American gay men imagine themselves and those around them.</p>
		<p>Mass media and social science representations of Latino masculinity resonate strongly with the figure of the macho or <span class="italic">activo </span>in the Latin American sex system. However, in a U.S. context, the racialized dimensions of these figures crystallize. Whereas in the Latin America constructed by ethnographers the macho is the dominant figure who (most) benefits from patriarchy, in the United States the macho is a racial inferior whose particular type of patriarchal power is criticized. In part, the macho works to deflect attention from how middle-class Anglo patriarchy operates across national and class boundaries. Below, I analyze how this racialization figures into gay representations and Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s self-identifications.</p>
		<p>Representations of young Latino men as virile, highly sexual, and masculine are common in gay media circles as well. As Christopher Ortiz argues, representations of Chicano/Latino men in gay pornography primarily marketed to a white gay male audience &#x201C;act as structures of desire.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> According to Ortiz, racial signifiers (conflated with class signifiers) figure prominently in gay porn videos that feature Latino men. In this pornographic niche, settings typically are left completely unidentified (a bed in a bare room) or are class-and race-coded: they include &#x201C;prisons, warehouses, restaurants, kitchens and urban areas that are defined as Chicano/Latino neighborhoods.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> Likewise, Latino men are sometimes represented as a &#x201C;homeboy or street-smart and tough urban resident, an image of the Chicano/Latino that is widely circulated in the dominant media.&#x201D; Viewers are reminded of race through the placement of racial signifiers such as pi&#xf1;atas. Chicano/ Latino men, like black men, are represented as being closer to nature, having an unbridled sexuality, being &#x201C;hot blooded,&#x201D; and possessing uncontrollable desires.<sup><a id="footnote_back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> Ironically, representations of uncontrollable Latino men whose desires can be and are satisfied by other men do not presuppose their homosexuality. Rather, Ortiz explains how gay porn employs the trope of unbridled sexual desire to exclude Latino men from gay community:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>One pervasive stereotype in gay pornography is the desire to be fucked by the Black or Chicano/Latino stud who does not reciprocate and may even be straight. . . . The fantasy of the straight macho Chicano/Latino man who fucks &#x201C;me&#x201D; (a white man) allows for sexual relations between two men and at the same time excludes the Chicano/Latino man from being framed as a member of a gay community. For a Chicano/Latino spectator, the identification can be a problematic one if he is attempting to articulate a sexual experience that may not conform to or may even transgress his own familiar cultural codes: macho-chingado/top-bottom. The white man can divorce himself from the cultural and ethnic implications for the Chicano/Latino of this fantasy scenario; the Chicano/Latino man cannot.<sup><a id="footnote_back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>This same trope is used in videos that feature Chicano/Latino men having sex with each other. In these videos, homosexual sex is portrayed as an element of male bonding &#x201C;attributable to a certain hegemonic notion of Chicano/Latino machismo.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> In both of these cases, Latino men are portrayed as masculine, sexual, and sexy&#x2014;but not gay.<sup><a id="footnote_back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></p>
		<p>My research suggests that Latino gay men also turn to pornographic representations both to fuel their fantasies and to provide a distorted mirror. This particular genre of pornography provides an index of meaningful symbols, possible roles (sexual and social), desirable subjects, and erotic situations that reflect social hierarchies of gender, race, and class. These representations structure the possible desires of viewers. In Miami, gendered and racialized <span class="italic">papi </span>images are molded to market (and simultaneously influence the content and representation of) particular gay venues. Eduardo Aparicio confronted these marketing strategies head-on when he tried to develop a Latino gay magazine that embraced both masculine and feminine images and voices. In the first issue of his zine, <span class="italic">Perra!, </span>Aparicio included a &#x201C;good number&#x201D; of drag and feminine images. He described the reception of this issue, especially from club owners whose advertising support he was counting on, as <span class="italic">&#x201C;fatal&#x201D; </span>or dismal:</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">EDUARDO APARICIO: T&#xfa; sabes, la cultura gay es, es muy devota de, del, de lo masculino. Entonces poner una loca en la portada no les cuadra. Que haya foto tras foto de travestis no les cuadra.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: &#xbf;A&#xfa;n cuando son las travestis, las mismas que estaban trabajando [en esos clubs]?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">EA: A&#xfa;n cuando son las travestis porque es en realidad un imagen femenina. Y lo que quieren ver son machitos medio en cuero.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">EDUARDO APARICIO: You know, gay culture is, is very devoted to the masculine. So putting a <span class="italic">loca </span>on the cover didn&#x2019;t sit well with them. Putting picture after picture of drag queens didn&#x2019;t sit well with them.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: Even if it was the same drag queen who performed [at those clubs]?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">EA: Even when it was those drag queens because in reality it was a feminine image. And what they want to see is half-naked <span class="italic">machitos.</span></p>
		</div>

    
		<p>As Aparicio indicated, owners of Miami clubs catering to Latino gay men wanted to control the images associated with their locales, and they hoped that gay Latinos would be represented by <span class="italic">papis </span>or <span class="italic">machitos. </span>Significantly, Aparicio&#x2019;s choice of the diminutive <span class="italic">machitos </span>(as opposed to machos) also suggests the preference for youthful, vibrant Latino sexuality. Most importantly, club owners wanted to see <span class="italic">papi </span>images to the exclusion of other possible representations of Latino gay men. Because Aparicio depended on clubs for advertising dollars and free distribution, he had to cater to their expectations to some extent. He did so by de-emphasizing drag queens and lesbians in the magazine even though <span class="italic">Perra! </span>always included an element of drag. To appease club owners, Aparicio continued to emphasize the Latino macho in the centerfold section of the magazine, &#x201C;Papi del Momento&#x201D; or <span class="italic">Papi </span>of the Moment, by providing the type of images owners hoped would be associated with their locales.</p>

		<p>Latino masculinity, intertwined in the popular imaginary with machismo, is thereby constructed as an object of desire in Miami&#x2019;s gay community. Representations of masculine, young, tough Latino men inform Latino gay men&#x2019;s self-understandings despite the fact that such extreme Latino masculinity is something with which few actually identify. Not simply oppressive stereotypes that portray Latino gay men as objects, these images wield differing levels of relevance to men&#x2019;s lives, desires, and fantasies and are manipulated by men in their own self-interest. Many of the images I discuss are inextricable from sexual desire. Moreover, when a particular brand of Latino masculinity is cast and promoted as more desirable, it can also be used to attract others.</p>
		<p>Luis, for example, often used gay phone or chat lines to meet potential sexual partners. In these interactions, he was able to play off of listeners&#x2019; racial/ethnic expectations. He elaborated on what he thought people expected or desired from Latino men:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Their ideal, I think . . . it&#x2019;s such an overtly, you know, maybe vulgarly to some people display of masculinity or of male sexuality laced with perhaps a weird little bit of, like, little boy tenderness or whatever. Like, they want . . . a New York or Miami style young homeboy . . . Bangee boy, whatever you want to call it, you know that gang-banger. . . . The image they&#x2019;re drawing in their mind, is of the young dark, you know, not African a hundred percent, but of a young, like, you know, olive to caramel skin tone, you know, with mixed features, goatee.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The &#x201C;ideal&#x201D; Luis described has very specific racial, class, style, and regional characteristics, and the &#x201C;display of masculinity&#x201D; tops the list of idealized features. Although Luis clearly saw himself as masculine, he did not believe that he fits this stereotype of Latino masculinity in person. Nevertheless, through faceless, semi-anonymous telephone interactions with other men, he was able to perform the Latino <span class="italic">papi</span>:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>You can kinda create an identity of who you are, so I mean I can put on an accent or a voice that sounds like one of these people that they&#x2019;re either fantasizing about or are merely attracted to, and . . . it&#x2019;s not a persona that, I couldn&#x2019;t keep it up in person, you know. I think I&#x2019;m too complex a person to just be that. . . . I mean if we get further into me and talking to me, you know, I speak both English and Spanish well, I think, or relatively well without any sort of specifically urban inflection.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>In short, Luis consciously performed the role of a racialized, young Latino man&#x2014;a masculine, tough, urban homeboy&#x2014;in order to be attractive to other men.</p>
		
		<div class="centeredImage"><div><img alt="added-image1.jpg" src="image/added-image1.jpg" style="width:100%" /></div><div class="imageCaption"><p>The centerfold section of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>was devoted to &#x201C;El Papi del Momento,&#x201D; a photographic layout mostly featuring Latino men, partially clothed&#x2014;precisely the &#x201C;half-naked machitos&#x201D; Eduardo Aparicio believed club owners wanted to see. This centerfold appeared in <span class="italic">Perra! </span>2, special issue, August 1996. Copyright by Eduardo Aparicio; reproduced with permission.</p></div></div>		

		<p class="extraIndent">Although Luis chose to present himself under the guise of stereotypical Latino masculinity, his statement also suggests a certain distancing from the <span class="italic">papi </span>persona. Luis recognized that his own &#x201C;complex personhood&#x201D; was in no way captured by unitary images of desired Latino masculine men.<sup><a id="footnote_back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> These enactments of masculinity are perhaps simpler to maintain during short phone conversations, and Luis found this persona difficult to keep up for very long. However, such conversations are often a prelude to sexual contact. When Luis met his phone or online dates in person, he tried to highlight features that might correspond to the stereotypical Latino macho. He continued his performance using &#x201C;maybe a hairstyle combined with facial hair, you know, and maybe like some like clothes that happen to be baggy.&#x201D; Although Luis did not identify with these Latino macho stereotypes and found it difficult to maintain them for sustained periods of time, he did not hesitate to mobilize these stereotypes in his favor. In his conscious enactment of racial and gender markers, he played with notions of masculinity, but such play has its limits. When analyzing other men&#x2019;s masculinity, Luis relied on naturalized notions of &#x201C;real&#x201D; masculinity, most evidently in his evaluation of muscle boys or &#x201C;typical South Beach guys.&#x201D;</p>
		
		<h3>Muscle Boys: Homogenized Gay Masculinity</h3>
		<p>In the late 1990s when I interviewed Luis in his South Beach apartment, a particular gay masculine look was becoming the dominant aesthetic in this Miami Beach neighborhood. With very rigid and homogeneous definitions of what was attractive, this discourse of masculinity produced a standard of beauty to which young gay men compared themselves. In the 1970s a similar aesthetic, known as the &#x201C;gay clone&#x201D; look, dominated U.S. urban centers and privileged a masculine, muscular body and a homogenized working-class uniform. This muscular and masculine gay look was interrupted by the impact of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. As the disease became identified with gay men, media images of gay men devastated by a mysterious wasting syndrome became ubiquitous. Partly as a reaction to and a retreat from this image, a new clone look linked to traveling parties known as circuit parties gained currency in many urban gay neighborhoods of the 1990s. The new look was the antithesis of the thin and frail images of gay men rampant in the mass media. Thus the new gay man in Luis&#x2019;s neighborhood was muscular, pumped up, healthy-looking, and masculine.</p>
		<p>According to Michelangelo Signorile, the circuit party subculture promoted a &#x201C;cult of masculinity&#x201D; that demanded &#x201C;conformity to a very specific body ideal&#x201D; that included a muscular frame with very low percentage body fat and little body hair.<sup><a id="footnote_back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> Russell Westhaver fleshes out the description of this body ideal: models in materials advertising circuit parties were &#x201C;invariably muscular, with gym-toned bodies, broad shoulders, well defined arms, v-shaped backs, washboard abdominal muscles, &#x2019;bubble butts,&#x2019; and short cropped hair.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> Participants in this subculture, commonly referred to as muscle queens, muscle boys, or size queens, had a complex relationship to youth.<sup><a id="footnote_back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> While this discourse of gay masculinity was associated with youth, it was often embodied and enacted by middle-aged men. Although the markers of youth (a smooth, toned body, for example) were clearly celebrated on the dance floor, in the magazines, and in the sexual market place, many circuit party attendees were older than this ideal.</p>
		<p>The circuit parties privileged higher-income gay men who could afford the travel costs, admission prices, and optional drugs associated with these day-to weekend-long events organized in different cities around the world.<sup><a id="footnote_back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> The politics of circuit parties have been a lightning rod for debates within the gay community, with critics such as Signorile lambasting the parties for promoting unsafe sex, drug use, and unrealistic body ideals and supporters like Eric Rofes celebrating the rites of community building at the parties.<sup><a id="footnote_back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></p>
		<p>While the militant politics of such organizations as ACT UP marked urban gay communities like 1990s New York and San Francisco, Miami was viewed as &#x201C;a kind of refuge from the destruction AIDS had wreaked in some American cities.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> In a short article on the making of a gay community in South Beach, Eugene J. Patron and David W. Forrest argue that this sense of refuge/escape, combined with the &#x201C;widespread use of steroids to combat HIV-related wasting syndrome&#x201D; to give men &#x201C;back their physical strength, fuel[ed] a heightened idealizing of muscle development that corresponded perfectly with the warm weather body conscious environment of South Beach.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back27"></a><a href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Miami, identified as it was with circuit party subculture, became a popular tourist destination for gay men. In the late 1990s, minicircuits had developed in Miami, replicating the feel of circuit parties in local weekly club gatherings. Because participation in the minicircuit did not involve travel costs, it was economically more accessible to a broader portion of South Florida&#x2019;s gay population.</p>
		<p>National commentators like Signorile and Rofes often note the &#x201C;whiteness&#x201D; of the circuit party/muscle queen scene. While the borders between black and white remained quite firm in Miami&#x2019;s interethnic gay culture, Latinos occupied a racially ambiguous and shifting position during the heyday of the circuit party. The presence of Latinos in South Beach&#x2019;s muscle queen culture was undeniable, even if many Latinos assimilated into the circuit party uniform. Recent Latino immigrants and second-generation Cuban Americans made up a large percentage of the clientele, Latino DJs were crucial in developing Miami&#x2019;s house sound, and a bicultural shtick humor by some drag queens was part of Miami&#x2019;s unique charm. The presence of &#x201C;hot Latin boys&#x201D; was part of South Beach&#x2019;s marketing strategy that so successfully attracted gay men from throughout the United States. In 1995 Glenn Albin described the desirable ethnic mix at Warsaw, one of Miami&#x2019;s gay clubs, for the national gay magazine <span class="italic">Out</span>:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Warsaw&#x2019;s enormous space and DJ David Padilla attracted many of mainland Miami&#x2019;s Cuban-American gay and bisexual men, who showed up for the early explosion of house music.</p>
		<p>The combination created a shot heard round the gay world: The new look of love was Latin, and exotic by New York standards. South Beach was hot and the men were hotter. Curiously, class and ethnic distinctions that segregate gay men in most American cities are shed in South Beach nightlife. Because the venues are so large and the dress code is standardized (tank top, jeans, and boots), it&#x2019;s hard to guess who lives with his mother in Hialeah or whose Range Rover key was found by the toilet.<sup><a id="footnote_back28"></a><a href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Latino gay men in Miami, who were predominantly Cuban American, were key participants in the emerging gay culture Albin describes. As Albin suggested, in some ways the Latino men simply blended into the huge parties of shirtless, muscular, attractive men. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to guess,&#x201D; Albin noted enthusiastically, which one of these men &#x201C;live[d] with his mother [in the working-class, predominantly Cuban American neighborhood] of Hialeah&#x201D; and which one was the affluent, (presumably) Anglo owner of a prohibitively priced luxury vehicle. Of course, if the Latino men were really that indistinguishable from the Anglo men, they would not have added &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; spice to South Beach&#x2019;s gay culture. In fact, Albin revealed their visibility. The &#x201C;look of love was Latin,&#x201D; just visible enough to distinguish Miami from other gay urban centers but not so visible as to threaten the dominance of whiteness.</p>
		<p>As Albin suggested, Miami&#x2019;s racial/ethnic categories and hierarchies differ slightly from those of the rest of the country. Whereas in most U.S. urban centers Latino men are clearly categorized as nonwhite, in Miami Latinos are often positioned closer to whiteness. Significantly, Miami&#x2019;s Cuban Americans typically understand themselves to be white and do not see a contradiction between participating in Latino culture, being a member of the white race, and enjoying a dominant place in U.S. economic, social, and political life. Whereas the Cuban American gay men I interviewed rarely explicitly identified themselves as nonwhite, coded racialized meanings emerged in their discussions about South Beach gay guys or muscle queens.</p>
		<p>These identificatory tensions underpinning Miami&#x2019;s racial language&#x2014;in which the men I studied and the Anglo circuit boys both staked claims to the same race&#x2014;framed various questions. For instance, how does this place-specific notion of masculinity compete with more generalized conceptualizations of Latino masculinity? How did Cuban American gay men place themselves in relation to the muscle boy subculture? Many men I interviewed either lived or socialized in South Beach, the Miami neighborhood recognized as the center of circuit party/muscle boy culture. The Cuban gay men I interviewed who identified with this scene aspired to achieve its beauty requirements if they wanted to be competitive in its erotic market. Cuban American men who identified with this scene did not describe this as racial or ethnic imposition. They simply strove to keep fit and look good. However, most Cuban gay men, young and old, described feeling distanced from the South Beach scene. Their critiques were rarely couched in terms of racial difference: instead, they complained about rampant drug use in the area, lack of adequate parking, and people being stuck-up. For men who did not identify with this scene, its expectations were experienced as limiting and confining. Therefore the aesthetic requirements of the South Beach scene, which I would argue are racialized, were experienced both as empowering by those who thought they met them and as confining to those who did not.</p>
		<p>Emphasized in the following account is a dismissal of the performed masculinity of the muscle queens. When Luis used the expression &#x201C;typical South Beach guy,&#x201D; I asked him what he meant by that, and he replied that these men are typically</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>very body conscious, but at the same time effeminate. Maybe not like consciously effeminate but, like, they can&#x2019;t hide the fact that they&#x2019;re gay. They may be built and huge, but they open their mouths and, you know, as I&#x2019;ve heard people from Miami, you know mainland Miami, or perhaps Latin people from mainland Miami say . . . &#x201C;Oh! One of these South Beach muscle men opens their mouth and you know she&#x2019;s a woman right away.&#x201D;</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>According to Luis, South Beach gay guys are described as being masculine on the outside but feminine on the inside. Their masculine exteriors are betrayed by the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; who is let out when they &#x201C;open their mouths.&#x201D; The idea here is that no matter how many hours they spend at the gym or how big they get, &#x201C;typical South Beach guys&#x201D; cannot conceal what is thought to be their true nature&#x2014;their effeminacy. For Luis, then, the South Beach look is a farce of masculinity. This masculinity is clearly seen as constructed&#x2014;the product of regular trips to the gym and steroid use&#x2014;and, therefore, not natural or real. On the other hand, the Latino macho Luis desired, a Latino meeting many of the criteria he adopted on the phone lines, was seen as more thoroughly and naturally masculine. Latino masculinity was cast as purer in comparison with the hypermasculinity of South Beach gay men. Ironically, in Luis&#x2019;s case, the naturalness of Latino masculinity was described by someone who reinvented that Latino masculinity to attract partners. Luis&#x2019;s own disguise seemed an almost comical construction (a fake accent, stylized facial hair, and baggy clothes), yet the same markers on others seemed more real to him and constituted part of a natural expression of masculinity.</p>
		<p>Both constructed and naturalized notions of gender and race inter-played in Luis&#x2019;s own identity, desires, and interpretations of surrounding masculinities. In this account, Luis evaluated the masculinity of the muscle queens and found them lacking. Ironically, the dichotomy of achieved masculine performance and the failure of effeminate men that emerges in the Latin American sex system resurfaces. In an effort to distance himself from the reigning South Beach gay archetype, Luis resorted to the gendered codes of the Latin American sex system.</p>
		<p>These competing discourses of masculinity (the <span class="italic">loca, </span>the <span class="italic">papi, </span>and the muscle queen) and Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s negotiation of these discourses illustrate the extent to which masculinity is performed in daily life. Masculinity is embodied in men&#x2019;s musculature as well as in how they position their bodies. Masculinity is performed by accessorizing with fashionable signifiers of masculinity. Masculinity can also be performed in a sexual seduction involving the invocation of the Latin lover. Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s masculine performances earn them certain benefits and protections. They described feeling physically safe because they did not &#x201C;look gay.&#x201D; They described the acceptance they received from their families, an acceptance they believed would have been much less readily forthcoming had their gender appearance suggested their sexuality. Finally, they described the benefits of moving comfortably between different heterosexual and homosexual spheres without repercussions. As sons, they also reaped particular benefits from families of origin who granted them relative freedom from surveillance, particularly as compared with the women in their families. Mothers and grandmothers also helped their sons and grandsons with laundry, housecleaning, and cooking, especially if they shared a home. Even if the successful performance of masculinity involved a strenuous and difficult process, masculinity had its privileges.</p>
		<p>Although I have argued that since the 1990s in Miami, discourses of masculinity have been central to Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s self-identifications, I do not mean to imply that gender transgression has disappeared from Cuban American gay culture. In the next chapter, I discuss one important aspect of gender-transgressive Cuban American gay male culture: the staged performance of Cuban American drag queens who gained loyal followings in both mixed and predominantly Latino settings based on a Cuban American shtick that incorporated Cuban divas and ethnic humor. These performances elicited overwhelming responses from Latino gay male audiences that seemed to suggest an identification across varying gender identities and immigrant generation.</p>

Ortiz&#x2019;s analysis centers on representations of Chicano men, with an emphasis on the U.S. West Coast.</p><p class="backLink"><a href="#footnote_back14">back</a></p></li><li id="footnote15"><p>Ibid., 84.</p><p class="backLink"><a href="#footnote_back15">back</a></p></li><li id="footnote16"><p>Ibid., 85&#x2013;88.</p><p class="backLink"><a href="#footnote_back16">back</a></p></li><li id="footnote17"><p>Ibid., 85&#x2013;86.</p><p class="backLink"><a href="#footnote_back17">back</a></p></li><li id="footnote18"><p>Ibid., 87.</p><p class="backLink"><a href="#footnote_back18">back</a></p></li><li id="footnote19"><p>Both Ortiz and Richard Fung note the importance of the intended audience of gay porn that represents men of color. Both analyze videos directed by Latino and Asian American men that invoke racist stereotypes and implied white gay male spectators. Ortiz remarks that whom a video is directed to is more important than who it is directed by.

Levine also refers to the circuit in his discussion of the clone subculture. Like the circuit parties of the 1990s and 2000s, the circuit of the 1970s was highly associated with masculine gay clone culture and recreational drug use. As Levine describes, though, the 1970s circuit referred to places for social and erotic encounters for gay men within a particular city. In his description, circuit seems to refer to a network of places that catered to clone culture. A distinguishing feature of circuit parties of the 1990s is the way in which they were marketed to and attracted men from a range of geographic areas to one particular destination for a set of weekend activities (Levine, <span class="italic">Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the Homosexual Clone, </span>ed.
