		<h2>5 NARRATIVES OF NATION AND SEXUAL IDENTITY</h2>
		<h4>Remembering Cuba</h4>
		
		<p>IN CHAPTERS 1 AND 2, I trace how the emerging Cuban state created a narrative of a masculine nation by contrasting it with the assumed weakness, unproductiveness, and effeminacy of male homosexuals. In much the way revolutionary Cuban narratives discredited bourgeois capitalism by associating it with gay male sub cultures, mainstream exile narratives discredited communism by asserting its relationship to male homosexuality and gender transgressions. Flavio Risech describes the first time he encountered a representation of a homosexual. The Cuban American exile publication, <span class="italic">Zig Zag, </span>featured a</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>limp-wristed Ra&#xfa;l Castro dressed in fatigues, high heels and a ponytail. . . . To cast the communist Ra&#xfa;l as a <span class="italic">maric&#xf3;n </span>was to reduce him to an effeminate, stinking wretch posing as a real man. . . . The <span class="italic">maric&#xf3;n, </span>like women, can be neither <span class="italic">revolucionario </span>in Havana nor anti-Communist <span class="italic">gusano </span>in Miami, because both of these identities require unambiguous and un questioned masculinity for their constitution. . . . As an adolescent and young adult, I understood these rules well, and therefore cloaked my emerging sexual desire for other men beneath an intricately tailored suit that read unequivocally as heterosexuality.<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Long before Ra&#xfa;l became Fidel&#x2019;s successor, his supposed effeminacy and questionable sexuality made him an object of homophobic humor among Cuban exiles. To a young Risech, the lessons were clear: to be effeminate and a <span class="italic">maric&#xf3;n </span>was bad, it made you similar to the despised communists, and it placed you squarely outside the Cuban exile nation. In anti-Castro Miami, to call a man a <span class="italic">maric&#xf3;n </span>is almost as bad as calling him a <span class="italic">comunista, </span>and the two epithets are often intertwined in all types of derogatory diatribes. The gay men who immigrated to Miami during the Mariel boatlift entered this urban context.</p>
		<p>However, in the two decades that followed Mariel, the narratives that placed homosexuality outside the Cuban nation and the Cuban exile community were challenged by gay cultural projects that articulated narratives of Cuba centering on male homosexuality. From the street culture of the Mariel <span class="italic">locas </span>to the celebrated visual art of the Mariel generation, from Cuban drag shows and gay Latino publications to the explicitly political work for antidiscrimination ordinances, cultural projects disrupted the circulation of images and words in which representations of gayness were tantamount to a &#x201C;limp-wristed Ra&#xfa;l Castro&#x201D; or slurs aimed at a variety of so-called bad people. In these new narratives of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad, </span>male homosexuality was not foreign to Cubanness but central to it.</p>
		<p>Both first-generation and second-generation Cuban American gay men navigated competing narratives of Cuba. In this chapter, I analyze the narratives of Cuba that emerged in men&#x2019;s accounts and cultural projects throughout Miami. To the gay men I talked with, Cuba was configured through narratives of memory, family stories, contact with recent immigrants, and (more rarely) visits to the island. These descriptions of Cuba varied widely from a Cuba remembered as a romanticized site of sexual pleasure to a Cuba structured around familial homophobia and heteronormative demands. The way gay men constructed Cuba and its relation to sexuality directly affected their own ethnic identity and their ability to integrate gay and Cuban American identities.</p>
		
		<h3>First-Generation Immigrants Remember Cuba</h3>
		<p>In 1997 Eduardo Aparicio invited me to present my research to a newly formed group of Cuban American gay men and lesbians, Coalici&#xf3;n CUBA (Cubans United for a Better Ambiente). In addition to the other cultural projects (editing the zine <span class="italic">Perra!, </span>writing a weekly column for one of Miami&#x2019;s free weekly Spanish-language newspapers, and creating public art that highlighted homophobia in Latino communities), Aparicio had organized this group. The meeting took place at the home of one of the members, a Cuban American lesbian, a few blocks away from Calle Ocho, or Southwest Eighth Street, the main artery of one Cuban American enclave. In this case, the politics of location were strategic, for Aparicio later confirmed that he had consciously chosen to claim space within Cuban American communities&#x2014;not in the recognized gay enclave of South Beach. In other words, the very location of the meeting already articulated a narrative of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad, </span>one that was not concerned primarily with inserting itself into dominant Anglo notions of the gay community but that sought to feel at home in the heart of the exile community instead.</p>
		<p>The group, which had met only a few times before, was primarily male with only three women present (including the host and myself). Every one spoke Spanish. As the meeting progressed, I learned that the men shared certain characteristics: they were all born in Cuba and now lived in Miami. Beyond that, the group was quite diverse. Some of the men had left Cuba over twenty years ago; at least one had come as part of Mariel; and one had arrived in Miami less than a year before the meeting. The participants included a middle-aged entrepreneur; an unemployed <span class="italic">reci&#xE9;n llegado, </span>or recent arrival, who lived with his aunt; and a working artist approaching fifty.</p>
		<p>One of the men, Roberto, greeted all new arrivals with a question, stated loudly for everyone in the room to hear. He asked all the men, &#x201C;&#xbf;Te gustan los negros?&#x201D; (Do you like black men?). Roberto tempered his question by explaining in pseudoformality that he was taking a survey of how many Cuban men liked black men and identifying himself as someone who did like black men. A few of Roberto&#x2019;s respondents answered in the affirmative, but most did not directly respond at all.</p>
		<p>Several things were established in these moments before the meeting officially started. One was a mood of <span class="italic">relajo, </span>an informal or unruly atmosphere that would not be contained for the rest of the afternoon. Roberto&#x2019;s question might be considered inappropriate, and it did seem to put off some of the attendees, for they simply ignored it. The tone of his remarks eventually did rub off on others, however, as the conversation flowed between serious topics, laughter, and jocularity&#x2014;a tone I associate with Cuban American culture in particular.</p>
		<p>Another important thing was established by this exchange. The assumptions underlying Roberto&#x2019;s provocative questioning began to construct a narrative of Cuba where black masculinity was a taboo object of desire. The association between blackness and virile masculinity has a long history in Cuba and the United States. This imagined black masculinity/virile sexuality is sometimes perceived as an object of desire (as Roberto&#x2019;s question suggests) and other times as a dangerous sexual threat. In addition to objectifying black sexuality, this conversation seemed to assume that no one who would attend the meeting was, in fact, black-identified. The specter of <span class="italic">el negro </span>was a taboo and a tantalizing object of desire for some, but he would remain, it seemed, outside this particular Cuban community. Therefore this community-building meeting began, as many do, with informal definitions of who was assumed to belong to the community. Although the skin color of meeting participants ranged in tone, all fell within the acceptable range of Cuban/Miami whiteness, and the exchanges between Roberto and the other men present reinforced that racial identity.</p>
		<p>Although Aparicio had hoped I would give a formal presentation of my research, an informal tone had already been set. As I began to discuss the interviews I had previously conducted with mostly young, U.S.-born sons of Cuban parents (or second-generation immigrants), the Coalici&#xf3;n members interrupted me and eagerly told me how they were different from my respondents. The young men I interviewed were Americanized, they explained. They, on the other hand, were Cubans and told me how gay life in Cuba differed from that in the United States and what being Cuban meant to them. They proceeded to paint a picture of their experiences and their narratives of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad.</span>
		</p>
		<p>Interestingly, some of the men reversed the commonly held valorization of gay life in the United States as somehow freer or better than gay life in Cuba. For example, one man said, &#x201C;Hay una espontaneidad en Cuba que aqu&#xED; la han perdido&#x201D; (There is spontaneity in Cuba that has been lost here). What others would label as progress and liberation is recast in this account as a loss. One attendee, Ra&#xfa;l, added that while people often discuss the repression of homosexuals in Cuba, he had found that there was an incredible amount of repression in the United States. He noted the patrolling of cruising areas and stated that he had been detained for flirting with a man on the beach in Miami. One man added that Cuba had a long history where &#x201C;la sexualidad&#x201D; (sexuality) was tied to &#x201C;lo prohibido&#x201D; (the prohibited) and &#x201C;el miedo&#x201D; (fear). Ren&#xE9;, whom I would interview later, cited authors such as Virgilio Pi&#xf1;era and Carlos Montenegro as examples of the long Cuban literary history that reflected this <span class="italic">sexualidad. </span>Ren&#xE9; and others lamented that the mystery of this <span class="italic">sexualidad </span>was also lost in the openness of U.S. gay life.</p>
		<p>Roberto spoke warmly about &#x201C;sustico,&#x201D; the threat of fright that characterized the pursuit of possible partners in Cuba. This fear emerged from not knowing exactly who would be receptive to a sexual advance. To illustrate his point, Roberto described going to a movie theater on a recent trip to Cuba. A young man sitting next to him subtly brushed his leg against Roberto. Roberto describes thinking to himself: &#x201C;Is he? Or isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201D; He ended his story by remarking that this whole pursuit &#x201C;era muy inocente&#x201D; (was very innocent). Miguel jumped in, incredulous, &#x201C;&#xa1;Parece mentira que t&#xfa; digas que eso era inocente!&#x201D; (I can&#x2019;t believe you would say that was innocent!). It remained unclear if Miguel emphasized the fact that Roberto was making this remark (I can&#x2019;t believe you would say that was innocent)&#x2014;let&#x2019;s remember Roberto&#x2019;s less-than-innocent opening question&#x2014;or whether this incident could be innocent at all (I can&#x2019;t believe you would say THAT was innocent). Al though part of the excitement of the theater encounter emanated from navigating the unknown intentions of the man in the next seat, Miguel&#x2019;s interruption drew attention to the fact that Roberto did know more than he let on. In Cuban and other gay narratives, the movie theater is a recurring site for anonymous encounters. There were and are recognized codes for cruising that men looking for sexual encounters (and those not looking) know. The brushing of the leg, sustained eye contact, and perhaps the use of a particularly suggestive but not widely known phrase were/are forms of communication used to express sexual interest. Miguel&#x2019;s remark highlighted that the <span class="italic">sustico </span>relies on sustaining an unknown that everyone involved already really knows. In defense of his position, Roberto compared his Cuban movie theater encounter with gay life in the United States where everyone walks around naked with a towel wrapped around them, and it&#x2019;s all out there. In comparison, he maintained, there was more of an innocence to the Cuban experience. Although clearly referring to sexual encounters in baths, Roberto used this example to generalize aspects of U.S. gay life that he found unexciting. In the United States, he suggested, you know where everybody stands and what everybody wants. The aspect of pursuit and the excitement of discovery are completely lost even if their existence in Cuba relied primarily on a suspension of disbelief.</p>
		<p>In the narrative of Cuba described by Roberto and other Coalici&#xf3;n members, the island is a romanticized site of sexual pleasure. In this narrative, male homosexuality is far from foreign to <span class="italic">cubanidad</span>; in fact, it is figured as central to or even constitutive of <span class="italic">cubanidad. </span>Many Cuban gay cultural projects also explored the connections between sexuality, desire, and <span class="italic">cubanidad. </span>In a separate interview, Aparicio argued that homosexuality has a central place in Cuba&#x2019;s defining cultural expressions: he claimed a central, and not marginal, understanding of gayness in Cuba. He used the case of the composer Ernesto Lecuona and his foundational composition &#x201C;Siboney&#x201D;&#x2014;a song often interpreted by Cuban American drag queens&#x2014;to make his argument.</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Entonces no es solamente que digamos que, bueno, hay una sensibilidad gay en la m&#xfa;sica. No es cuesti&#xf3;n de eso. Es que t&#xfa; coges, y una vez m&#225;s te repito, lo que quiz&#225;s sea la principal composici&#xf3;n que se ha tomado de una zarzuela de Lecuona que es &#x201C;Siboney&#x201D; y te encuentras el canto de un hombre a otro hombre. . . . &#x201C;Siboney,&#x201D; que es definitoria de la cultura cubana . . . pero que al mismo tiempo es un canto de amor de un hombre a otro. Entonces por eso yo digo que la sensibilidad gay y la cultura gay son centrales a la cultura cubana porque tienes obras claves en las que las dos se est&#225;n definiendo al mismo tiempo. O sea, no es marginal. No es que Lecuona haya escrito canciones de Cuba que no ten&#xED;an nada que ver con la homosexualidad y ten&#xED;a escondidas tres o cuatro canciones de [amor] que ahora las descubrimos. No es as&#xED;. Es que est&#225; haciendo las dos cosas al mismo tiempo y que logr&#xf3; hacer las dos cosas al mismo tiempo. Lo mismo la obra de Lezama, de Lezama Lima, lo mismo la obra de Reinaldo Arenas. Lo mismo la obra de Virgilio Pi&#xf1;era, la obra de Servando.</p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">Then, it isn&#x2019;t just that there is a gay sensibility in the music. It isn&#x2019;t about that. It&#x2019;s that you take, and I repeat, what is perhaps the most important musical composition of a <span class="italic">zarzuela </span>by Lecuona, which is &#x201C;Siboney,&#x201D; and you find a song sung from one man to another. . . . &#x201C;Siboney,&#x201D; which defines Cuban culture . . . but at the same time is a love song from one man to another. And that&#x2019;s why I say that a gay sensibility and a gay culture are central to Cuban culture because there are key works that define both simultaneously. So, it is not marginal. It&#x2019;s not that Lecuona has written songs about Cuba that have nothing to do with sexuality and then he had these three or four hidden songs that we have recently discovered. It isn&#x2019;t like that. It&#x2019;s that he&#x2019;s doing both things at the same time. The works of Lezama, Lezama Lima, the works of Reinaldo Arenas, the works of Virgilio Pi&#xf1;era, and the works of Servando are the same.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Through this narrative of Cuba, Aparicio and other Coalici&#xf3;n members were firmly rejecting the notion that homosexuality was foreign to <span class="italic">cubanidad. </span>On the contrary, they argue, some of the most recognized articulations of Cuban nationalism in music, art, and literature are infused with a gay sensibility.</p>
		<p>The narrative of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>also provided Coalici&#xf3;n members an avenue for critiquing U.S.-style gay liberation. By constructing a nostalgic narrative of another cultural form of sexual pleasure, they discount the notion of U.S. gay life as the most progressive form of homosexual relations. Rather, this narrative of Cuba suggests a &#x201C;gay structure of feeling&#x201D; different from that dominant in the United States.<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Ra&#xfa;l first challenged the notion that gay life in the United States is &#x201C;free&#x201D; by pointing out the ways in which his life as a gay man continued to be monitored and controlled by state agents. More profoundly, these men articulated the loss of a mode of experiencing sexual pleasure and interacting as homosexual men. Although he took an extreme position among group members, Ren&#xE9; stated that he never fully integrated to gay life here. &#x201C;No siento que pertenezco&#x201D; (I don&#x2019;t feel like I belong), he told us, even though he had lived in the United States longer than almost anyone else in the room.</p>
		<p>Cuban-born gay men&#x2019;s narratives of Cuba are far from homogeneous, and not all the men in this meeting remembered Cuba as a site of (lost) sexual pleasure. Miguel argued that the rest of the group was romanticizing gay life on the island. In addition to challenging Roberto&#x2019;s claims of innocence, Miguel argued that sex was so predominant on the island because men had no other way to explore relationships with one another. For him, because of the extreme repression of homosexuals, gay life in Cuba could only be sexual. In the United States, however, gay men were allowed to live well-rounded lives that also entailed other obstacles like paying bills and maintaining a job. He argued against the notion that life in the United States was more repressed than life in Cuba: repression in the United States was really auto-repression where people censor themselves. In this narrative, Cuba&#x2019;s repressive social system and state mechanisms defined the limits of sexual life. This narrative of Cuba led to his valuing U.S. gay life and critiquing the others for not fully enjoying the freedoms it brings.</p>
		<p>Although the men at the meeting disagreed about their visions of gay Cuban life, they agreed that <span class="italic">theirs </span>was the true authentic gay Cuban life, whereas that of my U.S.-born respondents was (uncomplicatedly) Americanized. They argued that men who came of age in the United States would not comprehend being gay in a Cuban context and would, therefore, understand themselves differently. As the meeting progressed, I was struck by how unquestioningly this group of men saw themselves as purely Cuban, uncorrupted by the almost twenty years of life in the United States some of them had experienced. As I pushed them a little on how their experiences in the United States had affected their narratives of Cuba, they began to admit that many of the manifestations of their <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>had, in fact, been learned or relearned in the United States. One man at the meeting coined the term <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n </span>to describe this process of relearning, reinventing, and redefining Cubanness. Although these men distinguished themselves clearly from U.S.-born Cuban Americans, they described a similar process of coming to terms with being Cuban. Because their narratives of Cuba centered on the authenticity of their experience, they veiled the constructedness of their Cuban identities.</p>
		<p>One example of <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n </span>came from Roberto&#x2014;obviously a very active participant in the meeting. He talked about how he had learned to dance <span class="italic">guaguanc&#xf3; </span>(a genre of Cuban rumba music) in the United States, something he would have never done in Cuba. Although <span class="italic">guaguanc&#xf3; </span>has been incorporated into mainstream Cuban popular music, it is not irrelevant that this form of dance draws from African rhythms and instrumentation. Roberto&#x2019;s point about <span class="italic">guaguanc&#xf3; </span>suggested that cultural markers associated with blackness came to mark Cuban ethnicity in the United States, but in the process became disassociated from a black racial identity. As these spokesmen for Cuban identity actually learned how to be Cuban in the United States, they also began to experience themselves as racialized beings. For example, at one point Ren&#xE9; began to explain how he actually felt less Cuban in Cuba than he did in the United States, but Ra&#xfa;l finished his sentence by stating &#x201C;aqu&#xED; te sientes negro&#x201D; (here you feel black). The Coalici&#xf3;n meeting was an unusual moment in my fieldwork in the sense that the racialization of Cuban American experience was explicitly discussed. Throughout my fieldwork and other experiences in Miami, I have found that light-skinned Cubans rarely refer to themselves in racial terms, and if they do it is usually to mark themselves as white.</p>
		<p>Narratives of Cuba were also inscribed in the men&#x2019;s appearances. To reinforce his <span class="italic">cubanidad, </span>Ra&#xfa;l announced, &#x201C;Tuvieran que tumbar todas la palmas de Miami para que yo pare de ser cubano&#x201D; (They would have to cut down all the palm trees in Miami for me to stop being Cuban). Although he admitted to some shifting cultural standards, he felt that generally his Cubanness had not waned in the seventeen years he had lived in the United States. Ra&#xfa;l wore his hair buzzed short. He had on a white tank top and black and white jeans with a print reminiscent of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s silk screens. Another man at the meeting remarked that when Ra&#xfa;l walked in, he thought Ra&#xfa;l had lived in the United States a long time (based on Ra&#xfa;l&#x2019;s appearance alone). They went back and forth a while because Ra&#xfa;l did not accept this assessment of his appearance. He maintained that his clothes were not a sign of his Americanization but rather just &#x201C;a look.&#x201D; Although Ra&#xfa;l wanted to assert that he was uncompromisingly Cuban, others contested his claims and read U.S. influences into his stylistic choices. This exchange highlighted how the men read ethnic/national identity through style, clothing, and hairstyles. It also revealed how the meanings of these styles and their relation to national and ethnic identity are contested within the group. I found myself having more questions. Namely, what narrative of Cuba is embedded in a <span class="italic">guayabera</span>?<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> What about those funky Andy Warhol pants Ra&#xfa;l donned?</p>
		<p>The discussion at the Coalici&#xf3;n meeting illustrated how different narratives of Cuba define Cuban American ethnicity even as they frame gay life. Most evident were the contradictions of Cuban racialization. At the same time that the Cuban American micro community (Coalici&#xf3;n attendees) was defined as white (or at least not black) through the invocation of <span class="italic">el negro </span>as desired object, the Cuban American experience was defined as becoming black or becoming marked by racial otherness. Although this paradigm might appear contradictory, I believe it reflects the dialectical relationship between Cuban whiteness and nonwhiteness. Being marked by racial otherness is centrally about desire in this context. The invoked but absent <span class="italic">negro </span>is an object of sexual desire. The same desiring, othering gaze Roberto invoked to question the desirability of <span class="italic">el negro </span>has been focused on men like Roberto himself. As Cuban American men see themselves as exotic others in the eyes of Anglo men (as I discuss in chapter 7) and as they experience life as immigrants, they experience their own racialization. This is a partial process that does not integrally challenge notions of Cuban whiteness.</p>
		<p>In the case of this meeting, <span class="italic">lo cubano </span>was defined not only by race but also by birthplace. The authentic Cuban experience was understood as that of Cuban men born and raised on the island. There was no audible disagreement on this point. Nonetheless, when pushed further on what defined Cuban authenticity, these men made clear that it was at least partly constructed in the United States through <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n.</span>
		</p>
		<p>There was disagreement on the content of this narrative. Was/is Cuba primarily a site of sexual pleasure or repression for homosexual men? The answer to this question leads to different methods of evaluating gay life in the United States. For those who view Cuba primarily as a site of sexual pleasure, this narrative serves to critique the limits of U.S. gay liberation. For those who view Cuba primarily as a site of sexual repression, the story serves to critique Cuban and Cuban American heterosexism and homophobia.</p>
		
		<h3>Second-Generation Cuban American Gay Men and <span class="italic">Cubanidad</span></h3>
		<p>Cuban American gay men who were raised in the United States construct narratives of Cuba quite differently than the Cuban-born Coalici&#xf3;n members. The Cuban-born gay men described above developed narratives of Cuba that rested on a claim to authenticity derived from their Cuban birth and Cuban memories. As noted above, even with these claims to authenticity, it is clear that their definitions of Cuba were transformed in Miami. However, second-generation Cuban American gay men were denied the myth of Cuban authenticity because of the place of their birth or upbringing. Rather than recall personal memories, they drew on a montage of information that Jos&#xE9; Esteban Mu&#xf1;oz calls &#x201C;exilic memory&#x201D;:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>I have lived through the auspices of memory. By this I mean to say that exilic memory has reproduced Cuba for me. Cuba, for this Cuban, is a collection of snapshots, disembodied voices over the phone line, and most vividly, exilic memories. The ephemera and personal narratives that signify &#x201C;Cuba&#x201D; for me resonate as not only possessing a certain materiality, but also providing a sense of &#x201C;place.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The Cuban American gay men I spoke with who were raised in the United States drew from family stories, exile narratives, contact with recent arrivals, and (more rarely) travel to Cuba to construct their own Cuba narrative.</p>
		
		<h3>Cuba as Parents&#x2019; Homophobia</h3>
		<p>One group of second-generation Cuban gay men I interviewed understood Cuba primarily through its reflection of their parents&#x2019; and grandparents&#x2019; homophobia. These young gay men, who did not have any direct experience of the island, constructed a narrative that drew almost exclusively on their observations of their parents or other older, heterosexual Cuban immigrants. The presence of families of origin in narratives of Cuba is not surprising given the physical proximity and regular face-to-face contact of respondents with biolegal relatives. It was difficult for this group of men to reconcile their gay identities with heterosexist narratives of Cuba. For example, when I asked Javier, a Miami-born gay man in his midtwenties, if he knew what life was like for gay people in Cuba, he drew on his own experience with his family and other Cuban people of that generation. They &#x201C;have a very negative image of Cuban gay people . . . so I guess it might have been a very hard or underground thing.&#x201D; I asked him if he felt this negativity informed his experience: &#x201C;Yes, because I grew up with parents who were Cuban. So yeah, their sense of limitation and prejudice kinda affected me.&#x201D; Javier associated being Cuban, or the &#x201C;Latin mind-set&#x201D; as he called it, with his upbringing and his family, and he identified more with &#x201C;American concepts.&#x201D;</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>A lot of my upbringing and family programming comes from that whole Latin mind-set and I find it very limiting, so I guess I don&#x2019;t want to have anything to do with it. Like the American concepts seem more liberating, more open. . . . Slowly but surely some attempts at reform in terms of, like, accepting sexual differences and stuff is there, but the Latins, or the Latin contingent of it, still seem pretty close-minded.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Javier had lived his whole life in the Miami area surrounded by Cuban Americans and other Latinos, and our interview took place in his grandparents&#x2019; home in a predominantly Latino neighborhood where he was living at the time. He told me toward the end of our interview, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think of myself as Cuban at all. . . . It&#x2019;s not a big deal to me.&#x201D; I asked him to elaborate: &#x201C;Well I don&#x2019;t go out looking for other people that are Cuban, or try to go to Cuban events, or talk Spanish a lot, or listen to Cuban music.&#x201D; He told me he does not feel a connection with people based solely on ethnicity.</p>
		<p>For men who developed a narrative of Cuba as an embodiment of their parents&#x2019; homophobia, Cubans were referred to as &#x201C;them&#x201D; as opposed to &#x201C;us.&#x201D; In these accounts, respondents described Cuban Americans as a clearly defined group from which they could distinguish themselves. Several men distinguished themselves so much from Cuban Americans that they were not sure if they should participate in my study at all. One respondent admitted that he would not have agreed to the interview if his boyfriend had not insisted. I asked him why he did not feel he should be a part of a study of Cuban American gay men: &#x201C;I was born in Miami. I was raised in Miami. I&#x2019;ve been raised in the United States, and my background is Cuban, but I don&#x2019;t consider myself a Cuban. I&#x2019;m an American with a Cuban background. I don&#x2019;t consider myself a Cuban.&#x201D; In this way, some respondents rejected association with other Cuban Americans and identified American and Cuban as mutually exclusive cultural categories. It is clear that many of the respondents who rejected Cubanness constructed their notion of a Cuban almost exclusively from an older, first-generation immigrant experience.</p>
		<p>In addition to othering and, therefore, distancing themselves from their descriptions of Cubans, most of these men characterized Cuban American culture in particular ways and directly linked their ambivalence to Cuban American culture with their lives as gay men. For example, several of the men characterized Cubans as generally antigay, homophobic, and misogynist, as did Javier. These traits, defined as specifically Cuban, were seen to conflict with participating in gay life.</p>
		
		<h3>Narratives of a Gay Cuba: Raised in the U.S.A.</h3>
		<p>Unlike Javier, other Cuban American gay men raised in the United States without direct experience of being gay in Cuba drew on different sources of information to develop their narratives of Cuba. Rather than draw exclusively on parents to develop an idea of Cuba, some respondents drew on information from first-generation Cuban gay men or other sources who described gay life on the island. With access to a Cuban gay aesthetic, these 1.5-and second-generation Cuban American gay men were able to make positive connections between their gay lives and their narratives of Cuba. As a result, Cuba stopped being the domain of homophobic parents, and gay Cuba became part of their own exilic memories.</p>
		<p>Juan was in his midthirties when I interviewed him. Born in Cuba, he came to the United States when he was only seven years old.<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> During his upbringing in Miami, Juan had gone through Americanization and a subsequent process of <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n </span>that drew heavily on his relationship with more recently arrived Cuban gay men. For example, in the context of telling me how the Mariel migration had little direct impact on his life in 1980, Juan discussed his relationships with gay men who arrived in Miami as part of Mariel.</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>They started to tell me stories of how it was in Cuba, and how being gay in Cuba was like, and going to eat ice cream at Coppelia or all these things. Now this movie that I saw, <span class="italic">Fresa y chocolate [Strawberry and Chocolate],</span> all brings that to life. I think that was a very good movie because, all the things I had heard of many years before now, I see how it all, how being gay in Cuba was, and everything was on the sly, on the sneak, and he touched your knee, whoa, wow, and that kind of thing.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Juan learned about the <span class="italic">sustico </span>and gay life in Cuba both from the accounts of first-generation Cuban American gay friends and from contemporary film depictions. When I asked Juan if he felt that gay life in Cuba was connected to his life, he responded, &#x201C;I think everything that has to do with being Cuban is directly tied to my life.&#x201D; In the context of telling me how he engaged with and distanced himself from the barrage of Cuban political information available in Miami, he again drew on the importance of a friend who immigrated during Mariel:</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">JUAN: I remember the first friend I met from Mariel, I thought he was very interesting, extremely, he was <span class="italic">so </span>educated, he spoke French, this guy was exceptional, he was artistic, he was whatever, and I was just like wow. And that&#x2019;s the thing when I started to meet people like that I wanted to be even more and more Cuban, I was just like wow, they really have it going on. I don&#x2019;t know what I thought was going on there before, but yeah when I finally put, when there was an actual person . . . so it was just that other incentive. . . . Now I had friends from there and who grew up in [post-1959 Cuba] and it was all very realistic, but I guess it did affect me on some level, if anything it gave me a push to rediscover my roots, more than anything. We have another friend that he took it farther than me.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: What did he do?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">J: He started making trips to Cuba. . . . He took it that much farther, and I don&#x2019;t know where he&#x2019;s at right now. . . . He also helped me out a lot because he would explain things to me, &#x201C;oh this is this&#x201D; and &#x201C;this is that.&#x201D;</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SP: Like what kinda things?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">J: Like anything from poems to artwork, &#x201C;this is what he means by this,&#x201D; and &#x201C;this represents this,&#x201D; and music he would say, &#x201C;this is a <span class="italic">guaguanc&#xf3;.</span>&#x201D; Another friend of ours, he&#x2019;s really into Cuban music. As a matter of fact, [he&#x2019;s a] Marielito, now that I think about it. He&#x2019;s so Americanized that you wouldn&#x2019;t think about it twice, but he&#x2019;s really into Cuban music, and when we go over to his house there&#x2019;s this whole explosion of like La Lupe and Olga Guillot, and I&#x2019;m like, &#x201C;Oh, my god, I remember some of that stuff hearing before in my house,&#x201D; a lot of the stuff actually, but then there are other things that you have to really be into Cuban music to really know about it, but he&#x2019;s from Mariel and . . . he hasn&#x2019;t wanted to lose his thing either. He&#x2019;s made it a point not to.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Although Juan did not physically bridge the chasm between Cuba and the United States, as did his friend who &#x201C;has gone much farther,&#x201D; he built symbolic bridges between two parallel gay experiences. As he met men his own age who had grown up in Cuba, he was surprised by how much they &#x201C;had it going on,&#x201D; and he was also reintroduced to Cuban culture. It was a Marielito, like Roberto from the Coalici&#xf3;n meeting, who became the educator about <span class="italic">guaguanc&#xf3; </span>and the world of gay Cuban icons. Juan described a feeling of surprise when being reintroduced to the music he had heard as a child in his parents&#x2019; house, music reinterpreted through a gay lens that highlights particular performers&#x2019; diva status (La Lupe, Olga Guillot). Juan&#x2019;s <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n </span>was mediated primarily by first-generation Cuban American gay men. Juan spoke of Cuban American culture as something that was uniquely his, as opposed to belonging to an older generation or a more conservative segment. For him, Cuban American culture was a living culture that he associated with the language he chose to speak, the music he listened to, and the people he befriended. Like Luis, whose relationships with older Cuban gay men opened &#x201C;a door to a cultural awakening&#x201D; that allowed him access to a gay Cuban sensibility, Juan also described the influence of personal relationships with Cuban American gay men who had grown up in Cuba in his <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n. </span>As they learned more about gay <span class="italic">cubanidad, </span>they developed narratives of Cuba in which they could situate themselves as gay men. They saw no contradiction between an ethnic Cuban identity and male homosexuality. On the contrary, they sought out particular Cuban forms of gay expression.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Perra!</span></h3>
		<p>In addition to these men&#x2019;s accounts, I found evidence of narratives of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>in cultural projects throughout the city. I have already mentioned <span class="italic">Perra!, </span>a predominantly Spanish-language publication produced between May 1995 and March 1998 geared to gay Latinos in Miami and distributed in stores and gay clubs. Although Eduardo Aparicio hoped for a circulation of 3,000, an average of 1,500 copies per issue were printed. <span class="italic">Perra! </span>was a small-scale, sometimes sporadic publication. Its issues focused on wide array of topics including gay life in Cuba, model Latino gay and lesbian marriages, Latino gay icons, growing up Latino and gay, nationality, and homosexuality. <span class="italic">Perra! </span>tried to represent Latino gay cultural life as complex, historically influenced, and not always sexy.</p>
		<p>At the beginning of this chapter, I discussed Risech&#x2019;s first encounter with homosexual representations in an exile publication, <span class="italic">Zig Zag. Periodiquitos, </span>as such publications are known in Miami, often circulated pejorative and mocking representations of male homosexuals. <span class="italic">Perra!, </span>in contrast, directly challenged heteronormative narratives of Cuba. Although it sometimes billed itself as a Latino gay publication, <span class="italic">Perra! </span>was overwhelmingly Cuban, not Latino in general. Except for the centerfold section and discussions of Latino clubs catering to a multi national clientele, most other content tended to be Cuban-specific. All regular contributors were Cuban themselves. Discussions of gay life and history in the home country and relations between more recent and older immigrants were mostly discussed in relation to Cuba and Cuban Americans.</p>
		<p>As discussed in chapter 4, the title of the publication itself invoked a narrative of Cuban gay sensibility. In the second anniversary issue, Aparicio further conveyed the zine&#x2019;s meaning and tone. In his editorial, he wrote of his baby <span class="italic">perrita, </span>abandoned by her mother at such a young age, raised by her <span class="italic">madrinas, t&#xED;as adoptivas, </span>and father.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> This <span class="italic">perrita </span>had traveled the world, making stops in Miami, Miami Beach, Hialeah, New York, San Francisco, and Havana.</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>La perrita ha metido su hociquito en muchas partes: ha querido ser marielita, balsera, refugiada y hasta husmeado a alg&#xfa;n o otro recluta. Todo por el bien de la cultura y el amor de la patria. Perra! no es sino una perrita sata y peculiar que adora toda clase de pajaritos.<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">The little dog <span class="italic">[perrita] </span>has stuck her snout in many places. She&#x2019;s wanted to be a <span class="italic">Marielita, </span>a rafter, a refugee, and has even snooped out one recruit or another. All for the good of our culture and love of our country. <span class="italic">Perra! </span>is nothing more than a peculiar mutt that loves all types of <span class="italic">pajaritos.</span>
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>In his witty style, Aparicio revealed much about the way he imagined the publication. In his play on the magazine&#x2019;s title, the Cuban gay expression <span class="italic">perra </span>again connotes dog, in this case a small or young female-gendered dog, <span class="italic">perrita. </span>Through the dog&#x2019;s travels, we learn a bit more about the magazine&#x2019;s history, its intended audience, and the narratives of Cuba that would dominate its content. <span class="italic">Perra!</span>&#x2019;s Cuban roots were never far from the surface. In the story above, the <span class="italic">perrita</span>&#x2019;s travels through Havana and Miami were clearly meant to suggest her Cuban heritage. The references to the &#x201C;good of our culture&#x201D; and &#x201C;the love of our country&#x201D; implied a relationship between this gay publication and Cuban nationalism. While playing with the recurring theme of Cuban patriotism, Aparicio pointed to a heterogeneous Cuban American gay community, one that embraced men who came during the Mariel boat-lift, those who had recently come on rafts (&#x201C;balseros&#x201D;), and those from varied class backgrounds.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Perra! </span>explored a variety of Cuban gay experiences&#x2014;discussing different migration generations, gay life on both sides of the Florida Straits, and both masculine-and feminine-identified gay men. For example, an early contributor to <span class="italic">Perra! </span>writing under the name Corin Desentellado explored the sexual travails of a <span class="italic">loca </span>living in today&#x2019;s Havana in a serialized novel. With sexual explicitness, humor, and drama, Desentellado discussed everything from cruising for a real man on Havana&#x2019;s famed sea wall, el Malec&#xf3;n, to the sexual awakening of a young <span class="italic">guajiro, </span>to a glimpse at life in the UMAP camps.<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Desentellado&#x2019;s short installments highlighted culturally specific forms of sexual desire and sexual conquest. While remembering the tactics of the UMAP camps, these articles highlighted the cultural expression of <span class="italic">locas </span>under oppressive conditions to dramatize their sexual power and conquests.</p>
		<p>In the issue devoted to <span class="italic">balseros, Perra! </span>included short testimonials from <span class="italic">balseros, reci&#xE9;n llegados, </span>and their admirers. These accounts examined gay expression in the Guant&#225;namo camps and the way Cuban Americans perceived <span class="italic">reci&#xE9;n llegados. </span>By exploring differences between and connections among the experiences of men who were held in the UMAP camps, Cuban Americans raised in the United States, drag queens and young couples living in contemporary Havana, refugees in the camps at Guant&#225;namo, and men who came during the Mariel boatlift, <span class="italic">Perra! </span>constantly disrupted a homogeneous interpretation of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad.</span>
		</p>
		<p>The political goal of exploring the experiences of diverse groups of Cuban gay men was often achieved in a deceptively simple way, through discussions of personal relationships. In an advice column, a &#x201C;reader&#x201D; asked about his American boyfriend, another asked if his <span class="italic">balsero </span>boyfriend took advantage of him, and Julie Mastrossimone wrote regularly about her Cuban love. The exile experience in these pages was not that of an established Cuban American middle class in Miami. Without the tone of political diatribe, <span class="italic">balseros, </span>Marielitos and Marielitas, <span class="italic">habaneros, </span>and Cuban Americans provided a jagged and provocative picture of Miami, where common nationality formed the basis of unity and the backdrop for emotional and sometimes painful discussions.</p>
		<p>By producing a publication where both Cubanness and gayness were central, <span class="italic">Perra! </span>directly challenged the idea that these were competing identities. In his regular column titled &#x201C;Dime que te pica&#x201D; (&#x201C;Tell Me Where It Itches,&#x201D; or, colloquially, &#x201C;Tell Me What&#x2019;s Bothering You&#x201D;), the psychotherapist Jorge Arocha dealt directly with the question of identities in flux. A &#x201C;reader&#x201D; wrote to say he felt he had been living two lives: one Cuban and another gay.<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> He asked how he could reconcile these two lives. Arocha responded that the tension between the Americanization of gay culture, which gives the impression that being gay is a uniquely U.S. phenomenon, and the &#x201C;frozen exile culture,&#x201D; which holds in place 1950s homophobia, contributed to a feeling that Cuban and gay lives are mutually exclusive. Almost directly responding to the issues raised by the Cuban Americans I interviewed who distanced themselves from Cuban culture, Arocha continued:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Lo que m&#225;s te puede ayudar a reconciliar estos dos mundos es fijarte en la tradici&#xf3;n cubana gay, que es tan netamente gay como cubana. La cultura y la historia cubana est&#225;n llenas de grandes figuras gay. . . . A pesar de la homofobia causada por el machismo y el catolicismo, los cubanos tenemos una fuerte tradici&#xf3;n gay, que mucho ha enriquecido nuestra historia. Por lo cual, te digo que s&#xED;, que s&#xED; puedes ser gay y cubano. &#xa1;Y a mucha honra!<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">What can most help you reconcile these two worlds is to focus on the gay Cuban tradition, which is just as gay as it is Cuban. Cuban culture and history are filled with great gay figures. . . . In spite of the homophobia caused by machismo and Catholicism, we Cubans have a strong gay tradition that has greatly enriched our history. And because of this, I say that yes, you can be gay and Cuban. And that&#x2019;s something to be proud of!</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The cover of the April 1997 issue of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>specifically dedicated to <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>featured a picture of a drag queen with a dress bearing the image of the Cuban flag (similar to one Celia Cruz used to wear) and a young masculine-looking man with a Cuban flag cap.<sup><a id="footnote_back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Posing in front of Havana buildings, blue ocean waves, and more flags, these figures embodied exaggerated kitsch. This issue in particular engaged in queering Cuban nationalism. Liv&#225;n, the macho, copped a tough pose with a cigar in his mouth, and gazed aloofly at the ground. On the other hand, Yoko, in her fabulous flag dress, looked directly at the camera with her hip slightly cocked to the side to show off the immense red platform heels that left her towering over her Liv&#225;n.</p>

		<p class="extraIndent">This queering of Cubanness actively mocked hegemonic and heterosexist <span class="italic">cubanidad, </span>but this issue did not just critique patriarchal, heterosexist Cuban culture because such a critique would, in and of itself, have also assumed that gay culture and Cuban culture were mutually exclusive. Instead, <span class="italic">Perra! </span>reclaimed a Cuban nationalism that is gay to the core. In his editorial introduction to the issue, Aparicio explained his vision:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Cubanidad y homosexualidad son palabras que riman. &#xa1;Y vaya qu&#xE9; rima! La trayectoria de la cubanidad se puede ver no s&#xf3;lo como sincretismo de lo espa&#xf1;ol y lo africano, sino como una &#xED;ntima y mutua sincron&#xED;a de masculinidades que se buscan, desean y compenetran, forjando as&#xED; al moderno <span class="italic">homo cubanus</span>. . . . Cubanidad. Homosexualidad. Libertad. &#xa1;Y vaya qu&#xE9; rima!<sup><a id="footnote_back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove"><span class="italic">Cubanidad </span>and homosexuality are words that rhyme. And what a rhyme! The trajectory of Cubanness is not only seen in the syncretism of the Spanish and the African, but also in the intimate and mutual synchronization of masculinities that search each other out, that desire one another, that interpenetrate each other, forging the modern <span class="italic">homo cubanus</span>. . . . <span class="italic">Cubanidad. </span>Homosexuality. Liberty. What a rhyme!</p>
		</div>
		
    
		<p><span class="italic">Perra!</span>&#x2019;s rejection of marginality and its assertion of a central claim to <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>functioned as community validation and cultural reinterpretation. <span class="italic">Perra! </span>reclaimed icons, used jargon, claimed some of the most important artists in Cuba&#x2019;s history, and deployed Spanish as the vehicle to convey these messages. It strove to provide Cuban and gay role models flamboyant and mundane, to write the history of gay Cuban life, and to explore how real relations between different types of gay Cubans might work themselves out. For some of <span class="italic">Perra!</span>&#x2019;s readers, this project was, of course, something they already knew, already spoke, already believed, and already were. For other readers, however, it spoke volumes about the possibility of an integrated community of Cuban gay men with acknowledged differences sharing a common history and validating their experiences.</p>
		
		<h3>SAVE Dade</h3>
		<p>In the late 1990s the Miami&#x2013;Dade County Commission (previously known as the Dade County Commission) once again considered including homosexuality in an antidiscrimination ordinance. As discussed in chapter 1, when a similar ordinance was passed and subsequently repealed because of Anita Bryant&#x2019;s Save Our Children campaign in the 1970s, gay rights activists made a strategic decision not to target Cuban Americans because they were believed to be so socially conservative that bringing this issue to their attention could only hurt the gay rights cause. Twenty years later, the leader of the gay rights effort was a Cuban American, and discourses of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>echoed in this campaign. Gay activists of the 1990s were able to integrate <span class="italic">lo cubano </span>with gay life and culture in their political campaign.</p>
		<p>The first time the Human Rights Ordinance was introduced, it was flatly rejected, and four Cuban American commissioners voted against the measure.<sup><a id="footnote_back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> In response, two gay rights organizations banded together as SAVE Dade. Cuban-born Jorge Mursili, who was often ethnically identified in media reports, became the group&#x2019;s visible and vocal leader. Mursili, often pictured in a business suit, presented a respectable image of Cuban American masculinity. In fact, he was able to gain the support of the Catholic Church partly because of his own religious credentials as a practicing Catholic. In a 1998 <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>article, a lawyer was quoted as giving the following assessment of Mursili:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>The knock on the [gay] movement in the past has been it&#x2019;s too aggressive, too far out of the mainstream. . . . In Jorge Mursili, the movement had a leader who laughs easily, learns quickly, listens earnestly, labors tirelessly and looks like the boy next door.<sup><a id="footnote_back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Symbols of Cubanness emerged in public mobilizations for the ordinance. During Miami&#x2019;s 1997 gay pride march, demonstrators expressed their support. The <span class="italic">Miami Herald</span>&#x2019;s coverage of this march noted that about half the participants were Hispanic.<sup><a id="footnote_back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup> The pictures documenting this rally in the <span class="italic">Herald </span>include one with several signs in Spanish, including one designed by Aparicio. This sign was also reproduced on the cover of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>and on the public art billboard Aparicio designed. In a simple font, the sign read simply that homophobia equals dictatorship. In the context of Miami, a reference to dictatorship is often quickly associated with Fidel Castro and Cuba, so this manifestation of public art especially resonated with Miami&#x2019;s Cuban American community. In the same newspaper picture, another man held a sign for Coalici&#xf3;n CUBA. The two men holding the signs donned straw hats that referenced tropicalized notions of <span class="italic">cubanidad. </span>These images directly disrupted a heteronormative narrative of Cuba and presented a narrative of gay <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>that equated the struggle for gay rights with the struggle against Castro&#x2019;s totalitarian government. They suggested that if you oppose Castro, you must also oppose homophobia.<sup><a id="footnote_back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></p>
		<p>When the ordinance passed in 1998, the images published by the <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>demonstrated the extent to which the gay rights struggle had become intertwined with Cuban iconography.<sup><a id="footnote_back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> Mursili was pictured in one corner, dressed in suit and tie, obviously celebrating the success. In the background, someone was waving a Cuban flag. The success of gay rights was repeatedly marked by signs of Cubanness: a Cuban American man, a Cuban flag. The fact that Cuban men embodied SAVE Dade&#x2019;s gay rights struggle helped displace long-held formulations of gay as synonymous with white men and gay rights as antithetical to Cuban cultural values.</p>
		
    <div class="centeredImage"><div><img alt="OyeLoca_html_631eef7a.jpg" src="image/OyeLoca_html_631eef7a.jpg" style="width:100%" /></div><div class="imageCaption"><p>This photograph, shown here on the cover of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>magazine&#x2019;s September 1997 issue, was taken at a demonstration in support of the Human Rights Ordinance that took place outside the Dade County Commission offices on July 8, 1996. The sign stating Homofobia = Dictadura was also featured in a <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>article about Miami&#x2019;s 1996 Gay Pride celebrations. Copyright by Eduardo Aparicio; reproduced with permission.</p></div></div>		

		<p class="extraIndent">I do not want to overstate the case. In the final vote, the majority of Cuban American commissioners still voted against including sexual orientation in the antidiscrimination ordinance. However, two Hispanic commissioners (one Cuban American and one Puerto Rican), Miami&#x2013;Dade county&#x2019;s influential Cuban American mayor, and a few vocal voices throughout the Cuban American community spoke publicly in favor of gay rights.<sup><a id="footnote_back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> The struggle over gay rights in Miami&#x2013;Dade County made some redefine or at least temporarily reconsider their heterosexist claim of what it meant to be Cuban in Miami.</p>
		<p>The hypervisibility of Cuba in Miami in the 1990s and the new millennium should not be underestimated. Narratives of Cuba were not simply nostalgic longings for a lost nation, but rather played an active role in dialectically constructing Miami for both first-generation and second-generation Cuban Americans. This visibility of the ethnic nation coincided with the politics of sexual visibility. Whereas homophobic depictions associated visible or &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; homosexuality with its communist enemies, Cuban gay men worked to challenge these associations. In some cases, they challenged these depictions by using the visibility and cultural centrality of male homosexuality to claim a right to the core of the Cuban nation.</p>
		<p>As this chapter demonstrates, there is no singular narrative of Cuba. As Cuban American gay men from different immigrant generations negotiated narratives of <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>and sexual identity, the importance of families of origin kept emerging as an important site where <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>was learned and negotiated. In the following chapter, I analyze Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s relationship with biological family or families of origin and how these relationships intersected with the politics of visibility.</p>

Jimmy Morales and Bruno A. Barreiro supported the ordinance. In addition, three African Americans (Betty Ferguson, Barbara Carey, and Dennis Moss) and two Anglos (Gwen Margolis and Katy Sorenson) also supported the ordinance, which had been introduced by Sorenson. Five Cuban Americans (Miguel D&#xED;az de la Portilla, Javier D. Souto, Miriam Alonso, Natacha Seijas Mili&#225;n, and Pedro Reboredo) and one African American (Dorrin D. Rolle) voted against the ordinance. Miami&#x2013;Dade&#x2019;s Cuban American mayor, Alex Penelas, publicly backed the effort for gay rights, as did Cuban Spanish- language radio talk show host Tomas Garc&#xED;a- Fust&#xE9;, who subsequently lost his time slot and was replaced by the antigay activist Reverend Oscar Ag&#xFC;ero. That Garc&#xED;a- Fust&#xE9;, a host in the world of conservative Cuban talk radio, would publicly support the ordinance on a show that had a likely audience of older Cuban Americans suggests the changing climate and the surprising intersection between gay rights and Cuban American politics.
