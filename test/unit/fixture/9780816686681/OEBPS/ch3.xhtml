		<h2>3 CULTURES OF GAY VISIBILITY AND RENARRATING MARIEL</h2>
		<h4>&#xa0;</h4>
		
		<p>IN MANY WAYS, 1980 was a year of urban anxiety that marked a transformation in Miami&#x2019;s urban, racial, and sexual landscapes. Cuban Americans who had immigrated prior to 1980 were fearful that the Mariel immigrants, often referred to derogatorily as Marielitos, would tarnish their reputations as &#x201C;golden exiles.&#x201D; African Americans and other non-Latino black Miamians worried that their opportunities in a declining economic situation were diminished by more Latino immigrants. Anglo Americans feared that the city&#x2019;s culture would never be the same, that Miami would be forever Latinized. Anita Bryant and her followers must have been equally horrified by the clearly celebratory performance of gender transgression that many Mariel gay men exhibited in their new homeland.</p>
		<p>Although gender-transgressive homosexual men received a great deal of media attention, they did not represent all homosexual men and women who entered as part of this migration. However, as I try to reconstruct here, a particular culture of gay visibility did emerge with this generation, a culture of visibility that can be understood as a reaction against historical conditions (e.g., the targeted persecution of visible homosexuals by the Cuban state). This culture emerged as a response to perceived, if not real, conditions in the United States (e.g., the belief that the United States was the land of gay freedom). In particular, this culture of visibility was constrained by the material realities of the impoverished immigrants who created and embodied it. As is reflected in the cases of &#x201C;broken sponsorships&#x201D; I describe in this chapter, many gender-transgressive Mariel migrants could not rely on the economic support of family and friends; simultaneously, their gender expression limited their opportunities for socioeconomic advancement.</p>
		<p>The evidence of the gay culture of visibility established by Mariel immigrants is both sparse and controversial. The attention garnered by the Marielenas, as one of my respondents referred to the gender-transgressive Mariel population, worried many, including Cuban American leaders who sought to break the association between the Mariel boatlift and unsavory populations. According to (perhaps) well-meaning leaders, the media was simply interested in sensationalizing stories (such as those focusing on the criminal element and homosexuals), and their focus simply worsened the condition of Mariel immigrants, many of them &#x201C;normal&#x201D; people who would have to fight against the stigma of Mariel for many years to come. My intention is not to belittle the urgency of the battle against the stigma of Mariel. As someone who lived in Miami both before and after the Mariel boatlift, I remember how viscerally non-Cubans (re)acted toward Cubans after 1980. The English Only efforts of the 1980s that I discuss in chapter 4 are but one electoral manifestation of the anti-Cuban and anti-immigrant sentiment that festered during this period. I also remember how passionately Cuban Americans reacted and how many sought to distinguish between the good Cubans (those who came before 1980, who spoke Spanish &#x201C;properly,&#x201D; had been raised with &#x201C;good&#x201D; morals in pre-Castro Cuba, and were mostly white) with the bad Cubans (the Marielitos who were clearly corrupted products of the revolution, did not speak Spanish &#x201C;properly,&#x201D; and were much more dark-skinned than the &#x201C;golden exiles&#x201D;). Within this binaristic context, the only way to speak favorably about Marielitos was to argue that they were not all that different from previous generations, but they were just like &#x201C;us,&#x201D; the golden exiles.</p>
		<p>With the benefit of over thirty years of hindsight, I propose a different argument here: the Mariel homosexual generation was different&#x2014;not inferior, but different. To pretend that there is no difference is to erase the history of this generation&#x2019;s persecution and the political significance of their identificatory practices. Moreover, such an erasure homogenizes diverse Cuban American histories. As I argue in the previous chapters, what was most harshly persecuted in Cuba during the 1960s and 1970s was not homosexuality in general but the gender-transgressive public display of male homosexuality. Given that male homosexuality was associated with effeminacy, a wide array of gender-transgressive behavior was believed to demonstrate one&#x2019;s sexuality, including wearing women&#x2019;s clothing, letting one&#x2019;s hair grow out too long, or wearing tight pants or colorful shirts. In Cuba, speech patterns, mannerisms, and even the people one associated with could cause suspicion and apprehension.</p>
		<p>Precisely these expressions blossomed in Miami&#x2019;s post-Mariel gay world. Young, poor immigrants who grew out their hair and then bleached it and wore housedresses in public in broad daylight re invented gender-transgressive homosexuality, drag, and transvestitism. They created a visible gay Mariel culture in 1980s Miami, primarily concentrated in neighborhoods like South Miami Beach and Southwest Miami. Clearly, not all gay men who migrated during Mariel participated in this segment of gay culture; in fact, only a small minority of the gay men who emigrated during Mariel identified with this sub culture. Nevertheless, the men who did choose the path of gender transgression added a new face to Cuban Miami and helped create the gay and transgender Miami that exists today. In this chapter, I gather the fleeting evidence of the gay culture of visibility that emerged in Miami after 1980. This very important moment in Miami&#x2019;s racial and sexual history is difficult to document: ephemeral, it faced a concerted effort to silence any documentation of its existence. In the spirit of Eduardo Aparicio, whose efforts at documenting the <span class="italic">rastros, </span>or traces, of post-Mariel gay culture I discuss in the introduction, I track the shifting responses to gender-transgressive Mariel migrants&#x2014;from outright rejection and silencing in the 1980s to fairly open acceptance by the turn of the new millennium.</p>
		
		<h3>1980: &#x201C;Tent City&#x201D;</h3>
		<p>In chapter 2, I discuss the different paths Mariel entrants took toward sponsorship. Some immigrants found sponsors while still in South Florida, but others were sent to resettlement camps around the country while they waited to be paired with unrelated volunteer sponsors. Unfortunately, for some Mariel entrants, being paired with a sponsor did not lead to the expected transition to independent life in the United States.</p>
		<p>According to Cuban&#x2013;Haitian Task Force documents, the sponsorship of an immigrant did not constitute a legally binding contract, but rather a moral commitment to &#x201C;aid an entrant in resettling in a new community,&#x201D; an undertaking designed to assist &#x201C;the individual or family [in] adjust[ing] to living in the community and finding housing, food, clothing and employment.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> When a Mariel Cuban was handed over to a sponsor, the sponsor was asked to sign a release form that included basic information about the entrant. Although the release form transferred to sponsors &#x201C;responsibility for the person or persons they take in,&#x201D; a memo about processing procedures in South Florida clarifies that &#x201C;it [did] not obligate them to keep those they sponsor.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Siro del Castillo, then director of South Florida&#x2019;s Krome North processing center, reportedly urged family sponsors in particular to &#x201C;be aware of their responsibility toward the entrant and not to &#x2019;leave him in the street&#x2019; if the sponsorship breaks down.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> Del Castillo issued this warning not out of an exaggerated sense of doom but because many sponsors&#x2014;inside and outside Miami, familial and volunteer&#x2014;were, in effect, deserting their Mariel charges.</p>
		<p>As early as June 1980, sponsorship problems were becoming obvious for certain populations among Mariel entrants. One FEMA document reported that a significant number of Cubans were being &#x201C;abandoned by their sponsors.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> Broken sponsorship cases, &#x201C;sponsorship breakdowns,&#x201D; or &#x201C;returnees&#x201D; (as they were labeled in U.S. government documents) included those who were abandoned or those whose relationships with sponsors had otherwise soured without a successful transition to independent living.<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Federal records estimate that 30 percent of re settled Cubans had &#x201C;broken sponsorships.&#x201D; Another estimate found that 60 percent of Mariel Cubans were not living at their sponsor&#x2019;s address by the end of the summer of 1980.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></p>
		<p>Broken sponsorships posed tremendous challenges for local areas where sponsorless Cubans were located. If all the Mariel immigrants were stigmatized, broken sponsorship cases represented the most marginal of the marginal. To deal with this population of displaced Mariel Cubans, who were sometimes homeless and wandering the streets, the City of Miami established two temporary holding centers to provide makeshift housing and food. The first was established in Miami&#x2019;s Orange Bowl, which had previously been used as a processing center. When that facility closed on July 25, 1980, city officials moved the remaining 650 Cubans to a new holding center at Latin River Front Park, which was situated under the I-95 interstate highway near Southwest Fourth Street. Although funded by the federal government, &#x201C;Tent City,&#x201D; as it came to be known, was run by &#x201C;14 harried city of Miami employees.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Before it closed on September 30, 1980, 4,000 to 4,700 Cubans were processed through Tent City, with 500 and 600 Cubans staying there at any given time.<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></p>
		<p>By the time Tent City was opened, the mainstream press had already printed stories about the large percentage of homosexuals in the unsponsored Mariel population. Since Tent City was conspicuously located in Miami&#x2019;s city center and afforded its residents only minimal privacy, the encampment provided a media spectacle. Here semi homeless Cubans from already stigmatized groups in Cuba and the United States&#x2014;homosexuals, blacks, and formerly incarcerated people&#x2014;cobbled together lives and cultures with only tents to veil their every movement. Soon, obvious homosexuality was noted by the press, visitors, and local residents.</p>
		<p>Early reports from agencies working with Mariel Cubans reveal the extreme marginalization of broken sponsorships. Discussing the Orange Bowl situation, FEMA director John W. Macy noted that &#x201C;many of the group are considered to be in the hard to place category and finding employment and permanent housing for them will be a long and difficult process.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> While Macy used the umbrella category &#x201C;hard to place&#x201D; and avoided mentioning any specific characteristics, the press and other observers more precisely defined what made placing this population &#x201C;difficult.&#x201D; For example, a <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>article described Tent City as &#x201C;Miami&#x2019;s first Cuban ghetto&#x201D; and included a carnivalesque description of the camp involving a &#x201C;midget,&#x201D; a boxer, threats of rioting, and a nearly naked woman whose clothes had just been stolen. In the story, two men identified by the journalist as homosexuals are quoted describing the conditions in the camp and its treatment of homosexuals. The writer casually introduces the first man as &#x201C;one of the Cuban homosexuals who lives there,&#x201D; language that suggests that the presence of homosexuals in Tent City was well known to readers. In the article, twenty-seven-year-old Juan Puente described arriving at the airport from one of the resettlement camps, presumably to meet a sponsor, and finding no one waiting for him. After &#x201C; &#x2019;walking and asking people questions . . . they took me to the Orange Bowl. From there I came here.&#x2019; &#x201D; A fifty-four-year-old homosexual wearing a &#x201C;wrinkled felt cowboy hat&#x201D; affirmed that the overall conditions in the camp were not good but that &#x201C; &#x2019;homosexuals aren&#x2019;t persecuted here. . . . Police have treated us very kindly.&#x2019; &#x201D; This quotation suggests that it was common knowledge among Tent City residents that &#x201C;homosexuals&#x201D; were a distinct group whose treatment by the state needed to be monitored.<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> More specifically, the article&#x2019;s description of the cowboy hat hints at the aesthetic cobbled together by the gay men who tried to construct temporary homes in Tent City.</p>
		<p>Mi&#xf1;uca Villaverde&#x2019;s documentary film <span class="italic">La ciudad de las carpas (City of Tents) </span>provides a much more thorough description of this aesthetic and the quotidian practices of homosexual residents at the camp.<sup><a id="footnote_back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup> Filmed with a 16 mm Bolex camera during the days before Tent City shut down, the low-budget film documents a fleeting moment in early post-Mariel Miami, providing a glimpse of the temporary communities that emerged in the camp and the outwardly directed performativity of its gender-transgressive residents. Villaverde&#x2019;s gaze is undeniably attracted to gender transgressions, as her narration vacillates between sympathetic and judgmental portrayals. Moreover, her film demonstrates how both visible gender transgressions and the voyeuristic gaze form key elements of Cuban American gay male culture.</p>
		<p>For financial and logistical reasons, the video and audio were not recorded together, which gives the documentary an eerie, surreal quality. <span class="italic">La ciudad de las carpas </span>presents images of camp residents with lips moving to no accompanying dialogue. Voice-overs by Villaverde and some featured residents provide sparse commentary on the population, the camps, and Castro&#x2019;s Cuba. While the documentary references black Cubans, Afro-Cuban religious practices, and former criminals (visibly marked with tattoos), the documentary&#x2019;s central focus is a group of gender-transgressive homosexual men. We learn a little about the paths that brought them here. Like one of the men quoted in the <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>article, two of the film&#x2019;s protagonists had formerly been housed in resettlement camps. In voice-over, they describe gender transgressions in distant camps where homosexual men put on cabaret shows, and &#x201C;the &#x2019;girls&#x2019; dressed like women and they got married and everything.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> The narrator adds that some of Tent City&#x2019;s gender-transgressive residents had relatives in the Miami area; however, &#x201C;their parents do not accept their lifestyle. They have different morals. There is a breach between them. Many moral tenets have disappeared, and in their place lies an amoral indifference.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup> It is unclear whether Villaverde suggests that the Miami residents who had spurned their newly arrived relatives were amorally indifferent or whether the gender-transgressive homosexuals were the amoral ones. Regardless of Villaverde&#x2019;s intent, for many Cuban American Miamians, the outward gender performance of the Mariel generation clearly manifested one chasm between the golden exiles and the Marielitos. As was the case with the Cuban state&#x2019;s persecution of homosexuals, it was not homosexuality per se that marked this chasm, but the obvious shamelessness of this homosexuality that seemed so alien and amoral.</p>
		<p>Amid the austere conditions of the camps and faced with the gaze of Villaverde&#x2019;s lens, the gender-transgressive Mariel migrants of Tent City perform for the camera and seem to enjoy their performances with no evidence of either shame or discretion. One still from the documentary&#x2014;strikingly similar to the image of the Fort Indiantown Gap resettlement camp included in chapter 2&#x2014;captures the campy poses of Tent City residents. In this image, Luisito, the most youthful in appearance, with his distinctive (<span class="italic">llamativo, </span>a Cuban might say) hair color, holds the stuffed animal that became the group&#x2019;s mascot. The other men exhibit different degrees of gender transgression&#x2014;slightly sticking out a hip, wearing a pair of woman&#x2019;s sunglasses, or combining a more obvious gesture with wearing a woman&#x2019;s halter-top.</p>
		
    <div class="centeredImage"><div><img alt="OyeLoca_html_7b382c63.jpg" src="image/OyeLoca_html_7b382c63.jpg" style="width:100%" /></div><div class="imageCaption"><p>Mi&#xf1;uca Villaverde&#x2019;s documentary <span class="italic">Tent City </span>chronicled the experiences of a group of Mariel refugees held in an improvised camp in an area below I-95 in Miami&#x2019;s downtown.</p></div></div>

		<p>Four gender-transgressive men emerge as primary characters in the documentary. In addition to the young Luisito, Villaverde highlights Jos&#xE9; Antonio, who we meet as he is getting his hair dyed in one of the tents; El Flaco, nicknamed for his slim figure; and 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, identified by the logo on his T-shirt. One scene reveals how this group of men created a performative aesthetic with very limited resources. As Villaverde writes in her script, with only sheets as props,</p>
		
		      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>Jos&#xE9; Antonio, 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> and others help El Flaco wrap himself in a colorful mantle. He spins and poses. He opens his mantle and then wraps himself again. . . . El Flaco sits on the bed, wrapped in his mantle. He lies down, imitating sultan poses. He gets up and starts dancing to the rhythm of the drums. He spins and uses the mantle like a great cape. . . . His face, wrapped in the colorful mantle, is seen very close up. He spins for the camera.<sup><a id="footnote_back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></p>
          </div>
		

		<p>In one of the closing scenes, the coquettish play between the men and Villaverde&#x2019;s camera is also evident. With Vivaldi playing in the background:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Two young transvestites <span class="italic">[jovencitos transvestistas], </span>around twenty years old, pose behind one of the tents. One wears a beaded lace dress with ruffles that fall over his shoulders and the other wears a black spaghetti strap dress. They both position themselves in different poses, one with the other. Facing forward. Back to back. They lean. They both are wearing women&#x2019;s shoes and near them on the floor are two women&#x2019;s straw hats. One covers his mouth with his hand, covering up his possible mustache, while the other brings his face closer.<sup><a id="footnote_back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The descriptive language Villaverde uses in her script reveals particular attention to their gender transgressions. She describes Luisito as walking &#x201C;with forced gestures <span class="italic">[gestos forzados], </span>moving his hips&#x201D; while he poses for the camera, and El Flaco walking &#x201C;as if he was a lady.&#x201D; She makes reference to their &#x201C;delicate fingers,&#x201D; their poses, and the way in which they embrace with &#x201C;affected gestures&#x201D; <span class="italic">(gestos amanerados).</span><sup><a id="footnote_back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></p>
		<p>Because the documentary highlights gender transgressions some believed should be kept private, Villaverde had to defend her focus. In an article, she justifies her interest and suggests that the men themselves stole the show: &#x201C;Perhaps they, because they were the most discriminated against amongst the homeless, touched my sensibilities more than others, and I dedicate a great part of the film to them. Or was it they who took over the film?&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> Both Villaverde&#x2019;s gaze and the agency of the homosexual men (did they take over the film?) are evident throughout the documentary and in the more widely available printed script. Although the film provides a mostly sympathetic portrayal of the camp&#x2019;s residents, Villaverde-as-narrator does not directly challenge the negative characterization of Marielitos.</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>These are youths, products of the revolution. With whom did they mix in Cuba, isolated from the exterior world, to become lumpen, scum? We do not need to blame them for being scum, if that is in fact what they are. Or for their lack of teeth or for desiring things that they never had.<sup><a id="footnote_back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Villaverde, therefore, leaves the question of whether the Marielitos are scum unanswered, but asserts that if they are scum, only the Cuban government can be blamed. This message&#x2014;clear in its attack of Castro&#x2019;s government but ambiguous in its assessment of the camp residents&#x2014;is ultimately overshadowed by the much more interesting accounts and visual representations of the men themselves.</p>
		
		<h3>Sex in the City</h3>
		<p>A promiscuous and visible gay Mariel culture developed in urban Miami after 1980. Some believed that Mariel gay men were more extroverted in the United States because they believed this was the land of unrestrained gay freedom. Armando, who arrived in the United States via Mariel, explains his initial perceptions of gay life in the United States:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Como es natural uno llega, se deslumbraba por el simple hecho de que hubiera una discoteca para hombres gay na&#x2019;m&#225;s, que t&#xfa; entraras y todo el mundo era gay, y no ven&#xED;a la polic&#xED;a a recoger a todo el mundo y llev&#225;rselo. Ya eso era un cambio tremendo.</p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">Naturally, when you get here you are blown away by the simple fact that there&#x2019;s a disco exclusively for gay men, that you go in and everybody&#x2019;s gay, and that the police don&#x2019;t come and carry everybody off. That in itself was a tremendous change.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Certainly the lack of certain types of persecution created new opportunities for gay expression (as did the severing of some immediate family ties upon migration); however, defiant sexual cultures had been developing within Cuba well before Mariel. As Reinaldo Arenas reminds us, it was during the most severe period of Cuban repression of homosexuals that &#x201C;homosexuality began to flourish with ever-increasing defiance.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> The combination of the perceived freedom in the United States with the defiant cultures that had already been developing in Cuba created the context for the immigrant gay culture that developed in 1980s Miami.</p>
		<p>What was that immigrant gay culture like? When I asked Ren&#xE9;, a fifty-year-old Cuban man who lived in Miami before and after 1980, what the Mariel time was like, he told me about radical changes in Miami&#x2019;s sexual life:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Oh my god, era as&#xED;. Yo pod&#xED;a recoger seis personas en las carpas, en la ciudad de las carpas o en el Orange Bowl. El sexo era tan, tan, tanto sexo, tanto, tanto, tanto, tanto, tanto, como esta ciudad nunca ha visto.</p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">Oh my God, it was like that. I could pick up six people in the tents, in Tent City or in the Orange Bowl. The sex was so, so, so much sex. There was so, so, so, so, so much, like this city had never seen.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Ren&#xE9; suggested that Mariel made Miami more sexually open. When I asked him to clarify how he thought migration changed Miami&#x2019;s sexual life, he explained:</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">REN&#xC9;: Por ejemplo el cruising, en las &#225;reas abiertas, en la calle, etc. Los gay americanos se volvieron locos. Hac&#xED;an cola . . . con el carro para recoger gente.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: &#xbf;Por qu&#xE9; era sexualmente m&#225;s abierto?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">R: Era porque eran sexualmente m&#225;s divertidos, creo yo. Porque los americanos son mucho menos extrovertidos en el sexo. O sea, ellos pueden estar sintiendo mucho. . . . T&#xfa; te das cuenta de que ellos terminaron ya . . . t&#xfa; no te hab&#xED;as enterado. O sea, eso pas&#xf3; y nadie te avisa, ni nada, no. En Cuba se dec&#xED;a, la gente dec&#xED;a, &#x201C;a m&#xED; hay que gritarme el palo.&#x201D; El palo es el sexo, y es esa cosa de decir lo que sientes en el momento que est&#225;s teniendo el orgasmo, de gritar, de decir, &#xbf;qu&#xE9; s&#xE9; yo? Y yo creo que eso a los americanos los enloquec&#xED;a. Los americanos son tan fr&#xED;os, tan aburridos.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">REN&#xC9;: For example, cruising in open areas, in the street, etc. Gay Americans went crazy. They would get in line . . . in their cars to pick people up.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: How was it sexually more open?</p>
		<p class="noIndent">R: I think it was because they [Mariel gay men] were sexually more fun. Because Americans are much less extroverted during sex. They could be feeling a lot. . . . You realize they&#x2019;ve finished . . . and you hadn&#x2019;t noticed. I mean, it happened and no one tells you or anything, no. In Cuba there&#x2019;s an expression, <span class="italic">a mi hay que gritarme el palo </span>(you have to scream your orgasm at me). <span class="italic">El palo </span>is sex, and it&#x2019;s about saying, yelling, saying what you feel in the moment you&#x2019;re having an orgasm, I don&#x2019;t know. I think that drove the Americans crazy. Americans are so cold, so boring.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The concept of &#x201C;gritar el palo&#x201D; reveals one irony about the interrelationship between visibility and silence: it is those men arriving from a country that persecuted public displays of homosexuality and public sex (a country, in addition, whose material conditions made privacy a luxury) who embody this notion of announcing one&#x2019;s orgasm. I see in the yelling, in the announcement of ejaculation, the direct response to systematic efforts to muffle homosexuals and underground sexual cultures. The silencing and the screaming, the persecution and the defiant announcement of sexual pleasure, depend on one another.</p>
		
		<h3>1990: Still Too Early to Embrace the  &#x201C;Spectacle of Blatant Male Homosexuality&#x201D;</h3>
		<p>Ten years after Mariel, in April 1990, the <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>staff writer Elinor Burkett once again focused media attention on the gay men who came to the United States during Mariel. Rather than simply report a number of gay migrants (as Warren Brown&#x2019;s controversial <span class="italic">Washington Post </span>article did), her human-interest story provided in-depth accounts of the migration of ten gay Cuban men.<sup><a id="footnote_back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> The story documented forms of persecution in Cuba, the motivations of gay men coming to the United States, the types of lives this particular generation of gay men developed, and the devastating impact of AIDS on their generation.</p>
		<p>The story highlighted the Mariel gay generation and how they shocked other gay men (Cuban and not) who had been living in Miami before 1980. Burkett&#x2019;s description of visible gay cultures describes both Tent City and everyday life in the wider urban environment:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>In the late summer of 1980 in Miami, everyone was noticing the gay men of Mariel. They were showing up everywhere, not exactly unobtrusively.</p>
		<p>Driving by the refugee Tent City under the I-95 overpass in downtown Miami, you could not miss the men in high heels and makeup, the men strolling with parasols, the men holding hands and kissing.</p>
		<p>Customers at women&#x2019;s clothing stores in Little Havana were left speechless as their countrymen in the next dressing room tried to wiggle into size 10 dresses and lace camisoles. . . . The more sedate majority went openly, unabashedly public with their homosexuality. . . . The less sedate went kind of berserk. They were flagrant, outrageous. Even Miami&#x2019;s gay population was appalled.</p>
		<p>When the men from Mariel arrived at Miami Beach&#x2019;s Arlequin Club, the old-time Latin transvestites complained loudly about the brazen newcomers who were cheapening the craft by cross-dressing not just onstage, but offstage, too.<sup><a id="footnote_back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></p>

		<p>Burkett described how these visible Mariel gay men had an impact at the street level, on daily life. Although gender-transgressive Marielitos were not the first to cross-dress in Miami, they did push the boundaries of acceptable behavior even within gay and drag worlds, as Burkett&#x2019;s account indicates. They were considered controversial precisely because they were public and visible in the context of everyday life, rather than limiting their behavior to specifically &#x201C;gay&#x201D; or &#x201C;drag&#x201D; settings.</p>
		<p>Burkett&#x2019;s article was met with much the same hostility and protest as Brown&#x2019;s. The <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>published reactions to Burkett&#x2019;s article from two commentators. The first, signed by Rene V. Murai, chairman of the Facts About Cuban Exiles (FACE), a group that promoted positive and accurate representations of Cuban Americans, was published on April 13, 1990.<sup><a id="footnote_back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> The second article, authored by Alejandro Portes, was adapted from a report previously authored for FACE.<sup><a id="footnote_back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">23</a></sup></p>
		<p>Portes began his critique of Burkett by focusing on the numbers of gay men Burkett cited in her article, a scenario almost identical to that played out when Brown&#x2019;s article appeared in 1980. Portes refuted two &#x201C;numerical assertions&#x201D; made by Burkett. He rejected the claim that 70 percent of the Mariel migrants were young men and denied the assertion that thirty thousand migrants were male homosexuals. Portes noted that a much smaller percentage of the Mariel migration was young men (defined as ages 18&#x2013;35). More than likely, Burkett misused the 70 percent figure, since that was the percentage of all male Mariel migrants (not just young males); however, Portes did not point this out. Although he recognized the difficulty of accurately estimating the gay population, Portes cited available figures about marriage rates of the Mariel immigrants and characteristics of the different phases of the boatlift in order to contradict Burkett and explain the source of her supposedly inflated figures. Although Portes attacked Burkett&#x2019;s un reliable figures, his estimates of the number of married men and adult males are equally unreliable, for they assumed that only unmarried adult males could be gay.</p>
		<p>In addition, Portes argued that the media were responsible for the misleading overestimation of Mariel&#x2019;s homosexual male population because of increased coverage of the migration&#x2019;s second phase. This second phase coincided with &#x201C;stepped up efforts by the Cuban government to discredit the refugees by forcing an increasing number of &#x2019;anti-socials&#x2019; to board the ships&#x201D;: people who arrived during the second phase were more likely to be held in camps. According to Portes, this media focus &#x201C;included the spectacle of blatant male homosexuality.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> Therefore Portes contended that the focus on male homosexuals drew primarily from the media&#x2019;s tendency to portray this more deviant phase of the migration. However, the media&#x2019;s focus on the later phase of the migration actually excluded gay migrants who had been reunited with families during the first phase; thus Portes&#x2019;s figures likely underestimated the total number of gays in the entire migration.</p>
		<p>In all fairness, Portes correctly pointed out that the media played a pivotal role in shaping negative opinions of Mariel migrants among U.S. residents. Portes did attempt to counteract a common tendency in relation to perceptions about Marielitos, the generalization of the experiences and characteristics of one subgroup of the migrants onto the 125,000 men, women, and children who arrived in 1980. However, his concern with how the overestimation of the gay Mariel population might stigmatize the whole Mariel population was also problematic.</p>
		<p>Portes stated that, because of the slanted media portrayal, &#x201C;it was difficult to remember that the majority of new refugees&#x2014;including those in the first phase and many detained in the camps&#x2014;were just ordinary persons seeking a new way of life in the United States.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> The implication here is that the blatant homosexuals Burkett interviewed were not &#x201C;just ordinary persons&#x201D;:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>When a quarter of any given group is portrayed as socially deviant, the entire group is tainted by extension. By advancing these figures, un supported by reliable evidence, the author transformed a &#x201C;human interest&#x201D; story concerning the personal misfortunes of some Mariel refugees into a general statement about the common path followed by many members of this group&#x2014;a homosexual career that ends with AIDS and death.<sup><a id="footnote_back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">26</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Portes was concerned that the stigma associated with blatant male homosexuality was generalized to all the Mariel migrants. In short, Portes failed to catch on to Burkett&#x2019;s goal of destigmatizing this population by speaking openly about them (rather than silencing them) and giving weight to their pursuit of liberty, their challenges to the Cuban state and Miami&#x2019;s exile values, and their own transnational cultures of resistance. For Portes to have maintained that Burkett wrote only about the &#x201C;personal misfortunes of some Mariel refugees&#x201D; was simply inexcusable. Sexuality is not only a personal matter; moreover, we know that &#x201C;misfortunes&#x201D; such as disease and stigma are socially distributed in particular ways. Burkett&#x2019;s article revealed a great deal about state persecution in Cuba, cultural views about homosexuality, the myth of the (gay) American dream, and the local impact of the AIDS epidemic. Although her figures might not have been accurate, the thrust of her article was not really about the number of gay men who were part of the Mariel boatlift; rather, it dealt with their cultural impact on Miami. In clinging to a quantitative high ground, Portes avoided asking questions about the sociological significance of the gay Mariel migration.</p>
		<p>The visibility of Mariel gay men after 1980 made the numbers game played out in the media almost irrelevant because even if there were few gay men, as some claimed, it was clear that those few had an impact on street culture, drag, and other Cuban Americans. The conflicting accounts about their numbers further confirm the significance of Villaverde&#x2019;s documentary, Burkett&#x2019;s account, and my own childhood memories. If an official story could not be told about the impact of the gay Mariel generation because of the lack of substantiated estimates, what was left were images of a fleeting subculture that affected a city&#x2019;s daily life.</p>
		
		<h3>The 1990s and the New Millennium: Incorporating  Homosexuality and Transgender in Miami&#x2019;s Memories</h3>
		<p>The year 2005 marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Mariel boat-lift. Events commemorating Mariel proliferated throughout Miami. Film screenings, commemorative newspaper issues, and television news stories participated in remembering and renarrating the Mariel moment. By 2005 Miami and its Cuban American community were ready to remember Mariel as a positive event and to approach the issues of male homosexuality and male-to-female transgendered women with less anxiety than before. In these retellings, homosexuals and transgender women appeared as positively recognized members of the migration. Given the negative reaction against marginalized Mariel immigrants in 1980 and echoes of attempts to silence the issue of Cuban American homosexuality in 1990, what is perhaps most surprising about this coverage was how male homosexuality and transgender issues were seamlessly incorporated into the 2005 commemorations. For instance, Lisandro P&#xE9;rez-Rey&#x2019;s 2003 documentary, <span class="italic">M&#225;s all&#225; del mar (Beyond the Sea), </span>includes the story of the Mariel immigrant Roberto, who had been imprisoned in a UMAP, and the transsexual actress Alana Inda, who discusses being imprisoned under the Law of Dangerousness for &#x201C;ideological diversionism&#x201D; <span class="italic">(diversionismo ideol&#xf3;gico).</span><sup><a id="footnote_back27"></a><a href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> The <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>created a time line of Mariel events for the anniversary. It also prominently featured issues of sexuality and gender identity. The <span class="italic">Herald</span>&#x2019;s website presented twenty &#x201C;personal stories,&#x201D; including that of Alana &#x201C;La Gata de la Habana&#x201D; Inda, who declares herself</p>
			
			<div class="blockquote">
			<p>the American dream personified. Meow! La Gata de la Habana! I changed my life and my destiny, and 100 percent my sex. I am physically and mentally a woman. I like to spread out on my Arab couch so you can see me. The only thing we need for that regime in Cuba to blow up is to fly me over there and put me on the Tropicana stage.<sup><a id="footnote_back28"></a><a href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The same website also included editorials and stories on new leaders, artists, Mariel immigrants living outside Miami, and &#x201C;Gays &#x26; Lesbians.&#x201D;</p>
		<p>Of course, much had happened in Miami since the 1990s that could help explain this new rendering of the gay&#x2014;and transgender&#x2014;Mariel story. In the 1990s the same southern Miami Beach neighborhood that had been home to a concentration of gender-transgressive Mariel migrants became an internationally recognized gay neighborhood and tourist destination. As I discuss in chapter 7, South Beach became identified with a racialized and highly desired Latino gay masculinity. If the fact that gender-transgressive Mariel gay men were concentrated in the same neighborhood soon to become the hot gay spot suggests a historical continuity, it is important to note some sharp discontinuities exist as well.</p>
		<p>The most prominent of these discontinuities is how gay Mariel appeared (or more often, did not appear) in Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s accounts of gay life, gay identity, and gay community. Luis, whose negotiations with masculinity I analyze extensively in chapter 7, was an elementary school student in 1980. He describes his memory of gay Mariel men:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>[I remember] seeing, you know, flamboyant, gay, you know, they weren&#x2019;t necessarily drag queens or transsexuals. I mean they were very effeminate gay men with brightly colored, brightly dyed orange hair. They were expressed in a more feminized way, but they weren&#x2019;t necessarily trying to pass as women specifically. Maybe in a place where gender roles are a lot more specific, they feel that in order, if . . . they&#x2019;re not going to pass as straight men who happen to have sex with other men, then they&#x2019;re going to express their gay way by looking more feminine and some were like drag queens or transsexuals. . . . If anything maybe I felt like a fear, maybe there was a part of me that, that part me that was trying to fight with what I had been accused of my whole life was like: I didn&#x2019;t want to be associated with that; I didn&#x2019;t want to be that; that was not what I was, even though I had maybe a subconscious fear that that&#x2019;s what I was being told I was.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The first adjective Luis used to describe the gender-transgressive gay men of Mariel is <span class="italic">flamboyant. </span>Even in childhood, Luis could recognize the transgressions of feminized ostentation that were stigmatized in Cuba as well as in Miami. Luis&#x2019;s account demonstrates how he interpreted Mariel gay expressions through his own emerging boyhood notions of sexuality and gender and how he interprets that feminization as an adult. As a boy who was beginning to suspect his own attraction for men, Luis confronted the new models of gay life&#x2014;as embodied by &#x201C;feminized&#x201D; Mariel men&#x2014;with fear rather than identification. The Mariel gay men transgressed gender and class definitions of appropriate behavior. As Luis confronted the gay men with only a partial understanding that he too might be gay, he wanted to distinguish between his type of gay and their type of gay. As a young adult looking back on Mariel, we see Luis place the need for feminine expression in a historical context, distinguishing between Mariel gay men&#x2019;s &#x201C;feminized&#x201D; expressions and the emulation of women. Also, he situates these &#x201C;feminized&#x201D; expressions in a cultural context that defines them as gay.</p>
		<p>Luis articulated a vivid picture of his relationship to one sector of gay Mariel. Within the context of my interviews, this type of explicit discussion of gay Mariel was unusual. Typically, the Marielenas slipped out of most men&#x2019;s accounts. Men rarely mentioned this sector of Mariel unless directly asked. Given the dramatic impact Mariel had on all aspects of life in Miami in general and on gay life specifically, I was surprised by these silences. In chapter 7, I place such silences in dialogue with fears of effeminacy articulated by Cuban American gay men and more broadly expressed in the celebration of masculine physiques that characterized gay culture in 1990s Miami.</p>
		<p>I interviewed Luis in the late 1990s in South Beach, the same neighborhood where many Mariel migrants concentrated shortly after 1980. By the time of our interview, this neighborhood had been dramatically changed by the emergence of gay male commodity culture. Unlike the <span class="italic">locas </span>who had lived here in the 1980s&#x2014;many of them poor immigrants&#x2014;more affluent, professional, and generally more masculine gay men began to flock to this area as occasional tourists, regular visitors, and residents. While gender transgressions and drag were not absent from South Beach, the rules of the neighborhood&#x2019;s market-driven economy slowly pushed away all gender transgressions that did not fit within particular types (star drag performers, for example). Working-class men, like Luis, who had grown up in this neighborhood found it increasingly more difficult to afford rents, even in the tiniest of apartments.</p>
		<p>Throughout the rest of the city, the Cuban American community had also changed. Much of the anxiety caused by Mariel&#x2014;will Cubans ever be seen as golden exiles again?&#x2014;had passed as a powerful Cuban American elite gained an unexpected degree of economic, political, and cultural power. In the 1990s, the Cuban American community began to show an internal diversity in terms of race, political generation, and cultural tastes. If the incorporation of the once-stigmatized Mariel generation played a key role in this diversity, so too did the ongoing entrance of newer generations of Cubans, including the <span class="italic">balseros, </span>or rafters, of the 1990s.</p>
		<p>In terms of my research, the literature on Latino gay male sexuality is also radically different in 2013 than when I started this project in 1995. In the mid-1990s, only a limited number of studies focused on homosexuality in Cuba, and the few studies on U.S. Latino gay men focused almost exclusively on active/passive models and HIV and &#x201C;risk behavior.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back29"></a><a href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> Since then, a growing body of literature on Latino/a gay populations has focused on different national origin groups, the relationship between immigration and sexuality, and the intersections of race, political economy, and sexuality.<sup><a id="footnote_back30"></a><a href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> My work is also in dialogue with scholars who employ a queer of color critique that uses a materialist cultural studies approach to analyze the intersections of race, gender, sex, and sexuality.<sup><a id="footnote_back31"></a><a href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> Along with queer of color scholars, I hope to analyze the cultures, experiences, and/or representations of queer people of color to provide a grounded analysis of how these interlocking hierarchies speak to and about one another. In the following chapters, I complicate this dialogue by focusing on a racial/ethnic group that often understands itself and is understood in a particular U.S. local context as white. Rather than take this white racialization at face value, I analyze how it functions precisely through gender and sexual discourses in the absence of explicit racial self-identification. My work is further informed by a broader literature on Latino/a gender and sexualities that points to the relationships among racialized structures that affect gay men and those that affect heterosexual women, lesbians, and heterosexual men.<sup><a id="footnote_back32"></a><a href="#footnote32">32</a></sup></p>
		<p>In dialogue with these scholarly literatures on Latino gay men, queers of color, and Latina/o sexualities, the ethnographic analysis of contemporary Cuban American gay male cultures that follows attempts to make connections between gay cultures of visibility and the silencing strategies that accompanied them. I draw on observations, interviews, and conversations with Cuban American gay men from various backgrounds. Both Cuban-born and U.S.-born men populate my study and the culture it seeks to reflect. I try to place these men in a transnational context that emphasizes both historic continuities (e.g., those bridges between the Cuban state&#x2019;s identification of gender transgression as a problem and the emergence of a gay culture of visibility in post-1980 Miami) and historic breaks (such as the disappearance of the <span class="italic">locas </span>from men&#x2019;s accounts of gay Miami).</p>
