		<h4>Gay Cuba in Drag</h4>
		
		<p>I BEGAN THIS BOOK by discussing the early decades of the Cuban Revolution. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Cuban state identified gender transgressions as a threat to the new virile subject imagined to be the protagonist of a new socialist society, namely <span class="italic">el Hombre Nuevo </span>(the New Man). In this chapter, I focus on alternative protagonists. If <span class="italic">el Hombre Nuevo </span>wore military fatigues and smoked a cigar, my protagonists preferred sequins and fierce pairs of high heels. If the soundtrack to the New Man&#x2019;s story might be one of Fidel Castro&#x2019;s famous speeches, my protagonists preferred another form of highly emotional Cuban rhetoric&#x2014;La Lupe&#x2019;s wailing songs.</p>
		<p>This chapter discusses the cultural work of Cuban American drag queens, <span class="italic">transformistas, travestis, </span>and other gender-transgressive performers in Miami. In particular I focus on performers who have developed characters or personas explicitly marked as Cuban. In addition to lip-synching, the performers highlighted in this chapter also host theme nights, work as emcees at various events, and perform a particular brand of stand-up comedy. Some notable examples of this type of performer include Adora, Mariloly (discussed in chapter 4), Julie Mastrozzimone,<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> and Marytrini. In my observations of gay Cuban cultural sites, I found that gender-transgressive performers played a key role in articulating gay <span class="italic">cubanidad</span>: Adora, Julie, Mariloly, and Marytrini embodied and performed narratives of Cuba. On one level, they transmitted information about gay Cuban icons, language, history, and forms of performance and expression that younger and older gay men alike were able to connect with on different levels. Their performances also are spaces in which Cuban gay men and (sometimes) lesbians are hailed in terms of their race/ethnicity and their sexuality simultaneously. The structure of those performances often included unscripted interactions between the performers and their audiences that allowed for those hailed not only to accept this identification passively but actively to participate in constructing it.</p>
		<p>In this chapter, I present different aspects of the work of four Cuban American gender-transgressive performers whom I observed during my fieldwork. My goal in this chapter is to analyze the complicated politics of immigrant generation, gender, and race to offer a glimpse of the heterogeneous and changing gay Cuban structures of feeling that permeated these venues during the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
		
		<h3>Adora: Lo tuyo es puro teatro </h3>
		<p>Popular among both Spanish-and English-speaking audiences, Adora was the most prominent bicultural drag queen in South Beach in the 1990s. In the early part of that decade, she led a fantastically successful drag night at Barrio Restaurant, in what was then an emerging, still somewhat underground, South Beach gay scene. On Monday nights, the small restaurant on Washington Avenue featured an all-drag wait staff while Adora hosted performances by local drag queens and DJ Sugar provided entertainment between sets. It was there that I saw her perform for the first time. With impeccable lip-synching, Adora regularly performed iconic, if somewhat eccentric, Cuban divas, all the while emphasizing their emotive potential through her theatrical performance. Although the performers I discuss in this chapter did not solely lip-synch, the enactment of songs shaped a significant part of their performances. In essence, their choices of artists and songs conveyed specific knowledges about Cuban and Latina divas to younger audiences. For instance, Adora&#x2019;s complex and layered performances were epitomized in her rendition of &#x201C;Siboney,&#x201D; composed by Ernesto Lecuona and interpreted by the Cuban songstress Xiomara Alfaro, among others. As I discuss in chapter 5, Eduardo Aparicio identified this composition as an example of a Cuban cultural artifact that simultaneously articulates <span class="italic">cubanidad </span>and a gay sensibility. If Lecuona&#x2019;s composition is somehow intrinsically gay and Cuban, Alfaro&#x2019;s interpretation (said to be Lecuona&#x2019;s favorite) is also queer in its own way. Unlike other Cuban female singers widely known throughout the Spanish-speaking world, Alfaro is more specifically a Cuban icon whose fans are primarily older Cubans. Adora&#x2019;s precisely timed movements, facial expressions, and lip-synching exaggerate the high-pitched tonalities of Alfaro&#x2019;s voice. Adora&#x2019;s persona is also a queered version of a Cuban society lady of the 1950s. Wearing mile-long eyelashes, exaggerated eye makeup, oversized rings, and Technicolor wigs that always perfectly coordinated with her outfits, Adora produced a femininity so queered and hyperbolic as to be almost cartoonish.</p>
		<p>In addition to Alfaro&#x2019;s &#x201C;Siboney,&#x201D; Adora also performed the iconic songs of La Lupe, perhaps the Cuban singer most imitated by drag queens. La Lupe, whose song &#x201C;Puro teatro&#x201D; I reference in the title to this section, was known for a raw and emotional style that was jarring (and intoxicating) to many of her contemporaries. La Lupe is the classic tragic Cuban gay diva. After leaving Cuba in 1962, she regained some fame in New York City working with Tito Puente. She eventually died penniless and alone.<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> La Lupe is best known for dramatic performances during which she would kick, cry, scream, and sing. Although recorded performances do not fully capture the unpredictability of her live performances&#x2014;La Lupe was known for throwing her shoes at audiences&#x2014;they showcase a vocal delivery both dramatic and honest.</p>

On May 15, 1999, she performed &#x201C;Siboney&#x201D; as interpreted by Xiomara Alfaro and &#x201C;Lo que pas&#xf3; pas&#xf3;&#x201D; as interpreted by La Lupe. Photograph by author.</p></div></div>
    
		<p>Like other divas, La Lupe sang about lost loves, her vindication, and her reassertion of her place in the world. In performing, identifying with, and reacting to La Lupe and her drag reincarnations, gay men across generations unabashedly celebrated their Cubanness in gay spaces marked as both predominantly Latino and mainstream. La Lupe&#x2019;s songs include exclamations, gasps, and various emotive outbursts. In Adora&#x2019;s lip-synching of these difficult numbers, each syllable, gasp, and exclamation is perfectly timed and delivered so as to exaggerate the already strong emotional impact of La Lupe&#x2019;s songs. Although La Lupe has been recuperated in the last few years, when Adora began performing her numbers, La Lupe&#x2019;s body of work and its relationship to gay Cuban culture was less known to U.S.-born gay men. The processes of gay <span class="italic">recubanizaci&#xf3;n </span>that I discuss in chapter 5 were partly facilitated by performers like Adora who transmitted a system of symbols, icons, and languages to other Cuban gay generations. Put another way, Adora both recalibrated and amplified La Lupe. She took songs young U.S.-born men might have heard their parents listening to and recalibrated them so that their gay sensibilities seemed patently obvious. When Adora performed &#x201C;Lo que paso pas&#xf3;,&#x201D; the pleading &#x201C;&#xbf;Qu&#xE9; te ped&#xED;?,&#x201D; or the defiant &#x201C;Como acostumbro,&#x201D; it seemed as if these songs were intended to be interpreted by a drag queen.</p>
		<p>Performers like Adora offered a crucial site for the transmission not only of historical information about these cultural icons but also of their emotional meaning. In chapter 4, Luis discussed how learning about Cuban gay culture from older gay men was a &#x201C;door to a cultural awakening.&#x201D; While he learned about La Lupe in this context, the first time he saw La Lupe interpreted live was by Adora at an outdoor party on South Beach&#x2019;s Lincoln Road. After that, Luis began attending Adora&#x2019;s Barrio shows fairly regularly and actively seeking out La Lupe&#x2019;s music to widen his understanding of this multigenerational gay Cuban culture. In a more recent follow-up conversation, Luis explained that after not speaking with his older gay Cuban friends for a year or two, he visited their house to tell them about Adora and talk more about La Lupe. He explained, &#x201C;I thought that was a bit of a circle going back to the &#x2019;teachers&#x2019; with what I&#x2019;d learned on my own.&#x201D;</p>
		
		<h3>Julie Mastrozzimone: &#x201C;&#xa1;Chusma!&#x201D; &#x201C;&#xa1;Balsera!&#x201D;</h3>
		<p>Unlike Adora, Julie Mastrozzimone and Mariloly did not often perform in English-dominant venues and never reached a high level of popularity in South Beach. However, they regularly performed using Spanish and Spanglish in or near mainland Miami&#x2019;s predominantly Latino neighborhoods. I most often saw Mastrozzimone perform during the late 1990s at a midsized gay club located on the border between South Miami and Coral Gables. Situated on US 1, part of which is a busy suburban thoroughfare that runs through Greater Miami, the club was discreetly tucked in behind a protective wall. On Wednesday nights or &#x201C;Latin night,&#x201D; the club closed off its patio and half of its interior in order to shrink the floor space and give the illusion of a packed house. In this more intimate venue, Mastrozzimone served as emcee, conversed with a lively audience, made jokes, lip-synched, and introduced other drag queens&#x2014;including those who competed in pageants that she dubbed &#x201C;las coronadas&#x201D; (the ones with crowns). In contrast to &#x201C;las coronadas,&#x201D; who wore expensive-looking, glamorous outfits and more closely approximated idealized feminine beauty, Julie wore simple wigs and light makeup. Her loosely fitting dresses were far from glamorous, and she often joked that she bought them at &#x201C;el pulgero,&#x201D; the famed Opa-Locka Hialeah flea market. Despite her &#x201C;cute&#x201D; features, she did little to embody feminine beauty or a sense of realness. In fact, she regularly disrupted the appearance of femininity with visual or verbal cues to her biological sex. During one performance, she lifted her dress over her head, revealing very unfeminine black male briefs. If Adora&#x2019;s character was a high-society lady, Julie developed a character with more of the aesthetic of a <span class="italic">chusma, </span>a derogatory Spanish term used in Cuban vernacular to identify someone as low-class and loud or raucous. Julie embraced a working-class immigrant ethnicity by joyfully embodying <span class="italic">chusmer&#xED;a.</span>

		<p class="extraIndent">Julie&#x2019;s hosting included relatively little scripted performance and drew heavily from interactive dialogue with an animated, heckling audience. Part of her skill was her &#x201C;chispa&#x201D; (literally, a spark) or her ability to respond quickly and humorously to the many comments shouted at her. In almost all the venues discussed in this chapter, the audiences were a vocal and active part of the performance. Audience interaction with drag queens is central to the cultural significance of the performance. In predominantly gay settings, the drag queens often hailed their Cuban gay audiences in explicit (and not the most polite) language. For example, Julie typically began her performance by asking if there were any Cubans in the house. When the crowd responded enthusiastically and positively, she would reply: &#x201C;Tantos maricones y tortilleras cubanos. &#xbf;Tus padres saben que est&#225;n aqu&#xED;? &#xa1;Qu&#xE9; pena, qu&#xE9; pena para el Sedano&#x2019;s!&#x201D; (So many Cuban fags and dykes. Do your parents know you&#x2019;re here? What a shame, what a shame for Sedano&#x2019;s!). Sedano&#x2019;s, a large Cuban supermarket chain found throughout Greater Miami but commonly in Cuban American areas such as Hialeah, here became something of a humorous metonym for a larger Cuban American establishment imagined to be heteronormative and ashamed of its many gay and lesbian relations. As might be expected in this gay Latino venue, the crowd&#x2019;s reaction was not one of shame but of loud, knowing laughter.</p>
		
    <div class="centeredImage"><div><img alt="OyeLoca_html_m7ab5f305.jpg" src="image/OyeLoca_html_m7ab5f305.jpg" style="width:100%" /></div><div class="imageCaption"><p>Julie Mastrozzimone was featured on the cover of the November 1996 issue of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>magazine. Copyright by Eduardo Aparicio; reproduced with permission.</p></div></div>

		<p class="extraIndent">Julie&#x2019;s audience typically responded to her in much the same disparaging tone employed by Julie herself. It was common for people to yell epithets such as &#x201C;chusma' or &#x201C;balsera' (rafter). Often, &#x201C;&#xa1;Balsera! &#xa1;Balsera! &#xa1;Balsera!' was chanted repetitively to drown out Mastrozzimone and force her to respond to the heckler(s). These epithets mark low-class Cubanness, stigmatized migration status, or both. Although technically not a <span class="italic">balsera, </span>Julie arrived from Cuba in 1980 as part of the stigmatized Mariel boatlift. She was one of the members of the Mariel gay generation featured in Elinor Burkett&#x2019;s <span class="italic">Miami Herald </span>article discussed in chapter 3.<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> If the audience sought Julie&#x2019;s mock anger and annoyance, she gave them what they wanted, sometimes deflecting these comments with a pretentious air, claiming to be upper class and not Cuban. Once, when she came across a couple from Cuba, as she was more than likely to do in this predominantly Cuban crowd, she responded with feigned snobbishness, &#x201C;&#xa1;Ay, la misma mierda!&#x201D; (Oh, the same shit). She went on to apologize and commented that she had heard that Cuba was a beautiful island, but she herself had never had a chance to visit. In that instance, she performed the role of the <span class="italic">cubana arrepentida, </span>that is, a Cuban woman who is ashamed of her Cuban-ness and tries to pretend that she is not Cuban and/or better than Cubans.<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> By this time, the crowd had erupted into laughter, and the chants of &#x201C;balsera, balsera, balsera&#x201D; momentarily drowned Julie out.</p>
		<p>The back-and-forth insults did not reveal a real animosity between performer and audience; instead, they reflected an intimate knowledge about a shared script. Within the boundaries of this imagined community, a member of a stigmatized group could hurl a powerful word, one that had been aimed at him or her in the past, in a playful fashion. When volleyed back, it would not sting as it might have outside this space. Mastrozzimone sometimes made this script visible by breaking character when she was supposed to be very upset and letting out her contagious giggle instead.</p>
		
		<h3>Mariloly: Political <span class="italic">P&#225;jaration</span></h3>
		<p>Both Julie Mastrozzimone and Mariloly performed in gay and heterosexual venues that catered primarily to Latinos. Of all the performers discussed in this chapter, Mariloly was probably most embraced by an older, heterosexual Cuban American population. She performed regularly in the drag queen revue Midnight Follies at the Cuban American theater, Teatro de Bellas Artes, which opened in 1983.<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Both Julie and Mariloly have also hosted evenings at cabaret venues or banquet halls in Latino neighborhoods for predominantly heterosexual Latino audiences. In Miami&#x2019;s Cuban American worlds, drag can be fairly well-received in heterosexual contexts, and it crosses over to quite diverse audiences. For example, Julie and Mariloly performed in a banquet hall in the predominantly working-class Cuban neighborhood of Hialeah, the type of venue typically rented out for <span class="italic">quincea&#xf1;eras </span>and weddings. The hall was rented out for a show featuring performances by Julie and Mariloly, and the performances were advertised in local Spanish-language newspapers. The majority of the audience at this type of event appeared to be Cuban American and heterosexual (as imperfectly as one determines either via observation). As demonstrated in the photograph of Mariloly&#x2019;s performance at a banquet hall venue, older men in this predominantly heterosexual Cuban American audience responded enthusiastically to her performance. Although inter actions in this type of venue were less likely to feature the exchange of gay codes and sensibilities of Adora&#x2019;s Barrio, they were active interactions nonetheless.</p>

		<p class="extraIndent">One respondent who was beginning to perform in drag as Gloria at the time of our interview discussed the relative place of drag in heterosexual Cuban American versus Anglo American settings:</p>
		
		<div class="poetry">
		<p class="noIndent">GLORIA: I mean I think that in shows . . . Latin people are much more into the show part of it. Like, &#x201C;Oh my god, there&#x2019;s a drag queen show,&#x201D; and they don&#x2019;t even care that it&#x2019;s a man dressed like a woman. They just think it&#x2019;s funny or cute or whatever. And they&#x2019;re much more artsy about it, much more like, much more advanced culturally than Americans claim to be.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">SUSANA PE&#xd1;A: Tell me more about that.</p>
		<p class="noIndent">G: Because, like, Cubans are used to a show. I don&#x2019;t think Americans are like. . . . Like, when I used to go to Lucky Cheng&#x2019;s [a restaurant/ drag venue located on South Beach modeled after a similar venue in New York City] like, there was people there, like, interested, but they purposely sought out to find a drag queen&#x2014;as opposed to . . . places [that] book like drag queen entertainment at a very Latin place, like bingo night, at Southwest Eighth Street, you know? You&#x2019;d never think it, but no, they&#x2019;re like, no they love it, it&#x2019;s like a big show. They&#x2019;re much more open about it that way. But Americans are like, um, I mean middle Americans, I guess, are more like &#x201C;Oh my God, that&#x2019;s a drag queen, that&#x2019;s a show, those are guys and it&#x2019;s all about makeup and stuff!&#x201D; Where Latin people are just, like, &#x201C;so what if it&#x2019;s a guy? It&#x2019;s funny, it&#x2019;s like a lot of fun.&#x201D; And . . . you see more Latin people at functions, whether gay or straight, at gay functions, and you see a lot more, definitely more straight Latin people at gay functions like pageants and stuff like that than you would straight Americans, middle Americans.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>These insights are partly substantiated by my research. I attended several drag performances where the audience appeared to be predominantly Latino heterosexuals. The broad appeal of drag performers might explain the recent rise of appearances by some gender-transgressive performers in Spanish-language television shows and theatrical productions. Mariloly and Marytrini, in particular, are widely recognized personalities in Miami&#x2019;s Latino communities and have come to occupy a significant amount of media space.</p>
		<p>Throughout her decades-long career, Mariloly has become especially popular among all audiences because of her enduring creativity, her well-thought-out performances, and her comic sensibility and timing. Part of Mariloly&#x2019;s appeal to an older, heterosexual Cuban audience draws from a comedic deployment of anti-Castro rhetoric. For example, in a regular lip-synched routine, Mariloly performs &#x201C;Sanitario,&#x201D; her own recorded song (featuring her voice) about the use of toilet paper&#x2014;or the lack of toilet paper&#x2014;in contemporary Cuban society.<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> In Miami&#x2019;s Cuban American culture, toilet paper emblematizes the material goods lacking in Cuba&#x2019;s economy. The toilet paper song is, therefore, an anti-Castro commentary. In this act, Mariloly, a drag queen, becomes the spokesperson for the Cuban American community, and her popularity with heterosexual and homosexual audiences of both established immigrants and recent arrivals adds legitimacy to this position.</p>
		
		<h3>Drag/Race</h3>
		<p>Adora, Julie Mastrozzimone, and Mariloly are all light skinned and understood to be white in Miami&#x2019;s racial taxonomy. How race emerges in the context of their shows is interesting. In one show, I observed an audience member ask Mariloly to do a particular joke. Her initial response was to scan the audience. Once she had checked out the crowd, she said she could do the joke and proceeded to tell a joke that equated black people with <span class="italic">carb&#xf3;n </span>(charcoal).<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> After hearing the joke, I understood that she was looking around the room to ensure that there were no black people in the audience, for they were presumed to be the only ones who would be offended by such a joke. The fact that Mariloly surveyed the room raises a few issues. The assumption is that anyone who is not black would not be offended by a joke like this. On the other hand, I question whether Mariloly would not have delivered the joke had she found a black person in the audience. I suspect that she might have delivered the joke with a preamble that engaged the black audience member in the joke. Perhaps if there had been a black (Latino) person in the audience, the joke would have featured Haitians, not simply the more generic category of <span class="italic">negros </span>(blacks).</p>
		<p>Manifestations of joking and communicating that involve an explicit and often (although not always) derogatory employment of racial categories are fairly common in Cuban Miami. Compared with the more coded racism deemed acceptable in Anglo-dominant settings, Cuban American ways of talking about race are much more explicit (and abrasive to those who have internalized U.S. racial etiquette). Both black and white Cuban Americans, especially first-generation immigrants of both races, tend to speak more explicitly about race. Therefore, jokes like Mariloly&#x2019;s that associate black people, dark black people, and/or Haitians (used interchangeably in different contexts) with negatively valued darkness or with something deemed valueless refuse are not uncommon in Cuban Miami. Of course, this makes them no less problematic. Given the way Cuban racisms permeated drag performances, I was particularly interested when a new dark-skinned drag persona emerged as a leading voice in Cuban American gay culture. Marytrini, who would be considered black by U.S. racial standards but would more likely be classified as mulatta in Cuban racial terms, also represents a different generational experience. Although Cuban-born like Adora, Julie, and Mariloly, Marytrini is part of the 1990s Cuban immigrant wave to Miami.</p>
		
		<h3>Marytrini: <span class="italic">Pionera Piola </span>or Race Revolutionary?</h3>
		<p>Marytrini is a fairly well-known personality in Miami&#x2019;s Spanish-speaking media world. On her website, she identifies herself as Marytrini and Alexis Fern&#225;ndez Mena, &#x201C;estilista&#x2014;actor&#x2014;transformista&#x201D; (stylist&#x2014;actor&#x2014;transformist/drag queen).<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> In this chapter I focus primarily on the live weekly variety/cabaret show she performed accompanied by las Divas del Jacuzzi, Cuban-born Teresita &#x201C;La Caliente&#x201D; and U.S.-born Cuban American Sophia Devine, at the nightclub known as Az&#xfa;car (2003&#x2013;10) and Club Sugar. That being said, it is important to note the other kinds of work Marytrini has done. In addition to her cabaret show, she has performed as Marytrini in other venues; opened the Marytrini Boutique in the emerging arts section of Calle Ocho (Southwest Eighth Street); acted in scripted plays such as <span class="italic">Sor-presas</span>; appeared on the internationally distributed Spanish-language talk show <span class="italic">Laura en Am&#xE9;rica</span>; appeared in various locally televised variety shows; served as a spokesperson for an HIV prevention campaign; and played a supporting role in the <span class="italic">La flor de Hialeah </span>airing on Am&#xE9;rica TeV&#xE9;, a local Spanish-language station.<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></p>
		<p>Az&#xfa;car nightclub is located within the city of Miami, caught between the neighborhood of Little Havana and the more affluent city of Coral Gables, in a decidedly Latino section of the Greater Miami area. Just off of Coral Way, the picturesque avenue shaded by banyan and live oak trees, Az&#xfa;car occupies a corner lot on a less picturesque cross-street surrounded by a low-rent strip mall and auto shop. Nevertheless, Az&#xfa;car is an impressive entertainment business venture. The investment in the show&#x2019;s physical space was evident in monthly updates to everything from expensive lighting and smoke equipment to more mundane elements like tablecloths and trays for wait staff. Every Sunday night, Marytrini and las Divas put on an original show consisting of two ninety-minute-long sets that included lip-synch numbers, skits, comedy segments, dance numbers, visits by local celebrities, and some live singing. The pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance at Az&#xfa;car, however, was Marytrini as emcee and the improvisations between official numbers.</p>
		<p>On most Sunday nights, the dance floor filled during intermission and after the end of the second set, typically with equal numbers of same-sex male couples and heterosexual couples. When the performance started, the dance floor cleared and became part of an expanded stage. The seated audience typically included a fair share of women in their fifties and older. Teresita&#x2019;s mother, for example, is a regular attendee. While it was clear that non-Spanish-speaking Americans and Europeans came to the show regularly, the majority of audience members were Latino men. The ideal audience for the show was a Spanish-speaking Cuban who grew up on the island and had spent some, but not too much, time in the United States and perhaps some time in Europe (or at least had some understanding of European popular culture). The range of references and inside jokes in the improvised routines was wide. For instance, references to the televised Russian cartoons of Castro&#x2019;s Cuba, the use of classic Cuban slang as well as the vernacular of those raised in the 1970s&#x2013;1990s, and references to the popular culture icons of postrevolutionary Cuba peppered the performances. The specific Cuban culture of Marytrini&#x2019;s generation also influenced the choice of lip-synch numbers and dance music played before and after performances. After months of attending the show, I began to hear more of the references that I had not previously understood. It was only after I started attending the show with men who had also lived in Cuba throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s and who were of Marytrini&#x2019;s age that I started to notice how densely populated the show was with references that required a knowledge of Cuba during the postrevolutionary period. When I asked those friends about a short word or phrase I did not fully hear or understand, they could explain a wide network of meanings that involved places, connotations, periods of Cuban social policy, and what was in vogue in Cuba in recent decades. In other words, Cuban Americans of Marytrini&#x2019;s generation were hailed throughout the show with very specific references to their experiences in Cuba.</p>
		<p>Although Marytrini appears as a beautiful African goddess in the HIV prevention campaign, in the cabaret/drag performances she often presented herself as someone who denies her blackness. She would often say incredulously, &#x201C;Yo no soy negra&#x201D; (I am not black), in a tone that suggested no one could or should ever think such a thing. Typically, she would continue, &#x201C;yo soy medium brown&#x201D; (I am medium brown). On other occasions, she would follow her denial of blackness with this clarification: &#x201C;Esto es un lunar que me cogi&#xf3; el cuerpo entero&#x201D; (This is a birthmark that has spread over my whole body).</p>
		
    <div class="centeredImage"><div><img alt="added-image2.jpg" src="image/added-image2.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div><div class="imageCaption"><p>Marytrini was among the twenty-five Latino celebrities featured in the &#x201C;25 Mitos, 25 Realidades&#x201D; HIV prevention campaign. &#x201C;Sexo Anal&#x2013;Marytrini&#x201D; cartel (print), 25 Mitos, 25 Realidades campaign, created by EMS Resources, Hispanic AIDS Awareness Program, in collaboration with Miami&#x2013;Dade County Health Department and Interart Media.</p></div></div>
		
		<p class="extraIndent">The show&#x2019;s racial politics can be quite off-putting to the uninitiated, especially to someone raised in the United States like myself. When I first saw Marytrini and las Divas perform in 2003, for example, there was a moment when I had the sense that I had walked in on a private joke between the performers and the audience. Of course, in my previous research on gender-transgressive performance in Miami, I had seen many other ongoing conversations, a kind of drag call and response that occurred week after week at given venues. Although I expected this format, I was still surprised because the audience teasing involved throwing stuffed monkeys at Marytrini, who seemed to be in on the joke, if somewhat surprised at the quantity of little monkeys involved. At some point, the floor was littered with what seemed to be obviously racist references to Marytrini&#x2019;s blackness. The monkeys were a gesture almost unimaginable in any other racial/ethnic drag setting.</p>
		<p>During my continued observations (primarily in 2004 and 2005), I never saw that many monkeys again, but they did not completely disappear either. For example, one evening someone presented Marytrini with a fair-sized stuffed monkey wearing a leather jacket, and Marytrini commented that she thought the monkey thing was over. In case there remained any doubt about what the monkeys represented, it was often verbally clarified. For example, in a recurring skit that consisted of Marytrini saying something in Spanish and English-fluent Sophia &#x201C;translating&#x201D; it to something completely different for comic effect, Sophia once mistranslated one of Marytrini&#x2019;s lines as &#x201C;Marytrini was born in Monkey Jungle,&#x201D; a theme park in South Florida. On another occasion, after Marytrini had returned from a trip to Brazil and complained that no one from Brazil had come to find her, Sophia brought a framed picture of a monkey from backstage and explained to the audience that the photo depicted the daughter Marytrini had abandoned in Brazil.</p>
		<p>Based on these examples, one might decide that the show celebrated racial exploitation, equated blacks with animals, and made a mockery of black culture. This conclusion might not be dramatically challenged by the fact that Marytrini is not only a performer but also appears to be a multifaceted entrepreneur and the creative force behind this and related performances. After all, how many blacks have not profited from black exploitation? This conclusion would not necessarily be off-base, but I would argue that that is not all that is going on. If we look more closely, it is not so clear that Marytrini was inviting the public to unproblematically laugh at her (with her?).</p>
		<p>One ongoing example helps illustrate the more complicated readings of Marytrini&#x2019;s performance that were possible. During various performances, she responded to being heckled and called a <span class="italic">piola. </span>On one occasion, an audience member who did not understand the term requested a definition. Marytrini told the audience that she had to explain the term because there were people in the audience from other countries who did not understand Cuban, and then she explained to the man who had asked that &#x201C;piola es una negra que le gustan los blancos&#x201D; (piola is a black women who likes white men). On another occasion, she responded to the heckling with a so-what attitude: everyone knows &#x201C;que a m&#xED; me gustan los blancos&#x201D; (that I like whites/white men). She added that everyone in Cuba knew she came to Miami (associated with affluence and whiteness in the Cuban imaginary). Did we think she was going to send her mother pictures of her with black people? &#x201C;No,&#x201D; of course not, she clarified, &#x201C;hay que hacer la raza&#x201D; (you have to make the race). On another occasion, however, she had a more complicated response to the <span class="italic">piola </span>heckling. She began with a statement that emphasized the undesirability of black&#x2013;black relations: &#x201C;Dos negros juntos, &#xa1;qu&#xE9; feo! Eso es como la noche sin estrellas&#x201D; (Two blacks together, how ugly! That is like a night without stars). As the audience laughed as loudly as they often did, she turned the gaze back onto them. She said, &#x201C;Blancos, &#xa1;no se r&#xED;an tanto!&#x201D; (White people, don&#x2019;t laugh so hard!), drawing attention to the racialized meaning of their laughter to that joke. She went on to add: &#x201C;que dos blancos juntos son como leche y espuma&#x201D; (because two whites together is like milk and foam). She reiterated to the directly identified white audience, &#x201C;no sean tan racistas y mezclen las razas&#x201D; (don&#x2019;t be so racist and mix the races).</p>
		<p>For another number, Marytrini wore a wig with straight hair, and she told the audience to look at her hair: &#x201C;esto es natural&#x201D; (this is natural), she exclaimed. How could anyone say she was black? She told the audience that white girls always do &#x201C;this&#x201D; and demonstrated by turning her head and flipping her hair from side to side, showing just how straight and flowing it really was. At that point, the skit emphasized her black denial and implied the superior beauty of the straight hair, but her black denial turned quickly to implicate the role whites play in &#x201C;this.&#x201D; &#x201C;Si una negra se aparece&#x201D; (if a black woman comes into the room), and she completes her sentence with a physical demonstration, flipping her hair at a much more accelerated pace, indicating how whites actively try to make blacks feel inferior and/or flaunt the characteristics they believe demonstrate their superiority. If at the beginning of the skit, the audience was asked to find humor in the ridiculousness of a black woman who thinks she is white, quickly the gaze shifts and what is ridiculed are the white girls who overenthusiastically flip their hair to exaggerate their whiteness in an effort to denigrate black women.</p>
		<p>While Marytrini often said racist or self-deprecating things, she sometimes actively stopped the same kind of racism when it emanated from her audience. For example, when someone from the audience yelled that there are no &#x201C;santas negras&#x201D; (black female saints), Marytrini altered her comedic register slightly, told the person he knew nothing about religion, and proceeded to list black saints like Montserrat in Spain and Santa Barbara/Chang&#xf3; in Cuba. In another instance, an audience member made a more serious claim to whiteness than Marytrini&#x2019;s flippant assertions, but Marytrini stopped him short. He was a good-looking man of mixed Colombian and Honduran descent: Marytrini commented that his was an unusual combination and added &#x201C;pero mira qu&#xE9; mulatico negro m&#225;s lindo sali&#xf3;&#x201D; (look what a pretty little black mulatto came from that). After she made a few other comments that included references to him being &#x201C;negro,&#x201D; he clarified: &#x201C;No, yo no soy negro. Soy . . .&#x201D; (no, I&#x2019;m not black. I am . . . ). Since he was not wearing a microphone I could not hear his clarification, but Marytrini jumped in to add &#x201C;y eres racista tambi&#xE9;n&#x201D; (and you&#x2019;re a racist, too). He denied this and looked embarrassed by the interaction, but Marytrini did not let it go: &#x201C;Verdad que hay descarados. Decirme que no es negro con esa piel. Quieren ser medium brown como yo&#x201D; (Some people are really shameless. Tells me he&#x2019;s not black with that skin. They want to be medium brown like me). While returning to her ongoing joke (&#x201C;medium brown&#x201D;) and, therefore, literally and figuratively lightening the mood, Marytrini found it important to disrupt the denial (shame) of blackness when not presented within her own loosely scripted persona.</p>
		<p>Another part of the show that illustrates a more complicated discussion of race occurred during a skit where Sophia and Teresita played the parts of <span class="italic">locutoras </span>(news anchors) while Marytrini acted as a sign-language interpreter. The mock news show presented a range of racially charged fictional news stories. As the white anchors went from racist innuendo to outright delighting in racism, Marytrini silently responded through pantomime. When the anchors described someone as a crazy black woman, Marytrini gave them a dirty look. The anchors continued the news story, saying that the woman had left a cigarette on her bed, the house had burned down, her three kids had severe burns, and now they looked like <span class="italic">chicharr&#xf3;n </span>(Cuban-style fried pork rinds). The anchors continued to describe the children&#x2019;s skin, and Marytrini indicated that she was getting sick of their callous description by pantomiming a gag reflex. Toward the end of the skit, the anchors defined &#x201C;black&#x201D; using a slew of negative associations whose English-language equivalents would be things like the black plague or a black widow spider. After the long racist diatribe, the anchors started to say &#x201C;si ves un negro educado, ingeniero . . .&#x201D; (if you see an educated black man, an engineer . . .). Marytrini pantomimed her hopefulness that something positive was going to be said about black men, but the anchors continued &#x201C;entonces est&#225;n viendo un blanco tostado&#x201D; (then what you are seeing is a toasted white man). This multilayered skit provokes the question: What precisely is the audience laughing at? Some in the audience were likely laughing along with the Cuban American racist humor that devalues blackness, much as Mariloly&#x2019;s audience. On the other hand, this skit could be interpreted as a commentary of bias in Spanish-language news media in South Florida that has very limited and often negative portrayals of blacks. Most importantly, Marytrini&#x2019;s silent &#x201C;talking back&#x201D; at these images invites the audience to think about how these pejorative associations to blackness are seen by a black Cuban audience. Marytrini shows a black subject not only as an entertainer for a white audience but also as a cultural citizen who receives, evaluates, and critiques dominant media.</p>

		<p class="extraIndent">In another skit, the Statue of Liberty (played by the Miami comedian and regular Az&#xfa;car guest Zulema Cruz) was being interviewed by a journalist (played by Marytrini). The first component of the joke involved characterizing the statue as a vulgar woman: many men have passed between her legs. After various exchanges in which Marytrini tried to ask a professional question but the statue responded vulgarly, Marytrini turned to leave saying that the interview would not be published. The statue began to plead &#x201C;ay mulata, no me hagas eso, por favor&#x201D; (oh mulatta, don&#x2019;t do that to me please). When Marytrini continued to walk off, the statue lost her polite demeanor and went from calling Marytrini a &#x201C;mulata&#x201D; to calling her &#x201C;negra de mierda&#x201D; (black piece of shit) and adding &#x201C;ten&#xED;a que ser negra&#x201D; (it just had to be a black woman). This exchange highlighted the hypocrisy of white Cubans who often use terms they see as more positive and/or not racially charged (mulatta or diminutives like <span class="italic">mulatica</span>). However, the skit went on to demonstrate that such a superficial veneer typically rubs right off to reveal an underlying clear disdain for blacks. This skit also can be interpreted in different ways: Is the audience being invited to laugh because we think Marytrini is &#x201C;una negra de mierda&#x201D; and we are laughing directly at her? Or, as I suggest above, are we being invited to laugh at the hypocrisy of white Cuban racism? I suspect a little of both is going on, especially when a diverse audience responds and interprets her performance from differing vantage points.</p>
		<p>During one show in particular Az&#xfa;car was poised to celebrate several huge accomplishments. Marytrini and the club had been featured on the cover of <span class="italic">Viernes, </span>the weekend magazine section of the <span class="italic">El Nuevo Herald</span>; Marytrini and las Divas had just finished filming short promos for the top Spanish-language television network in the country, Univision; and they were set to host the first annual Az&#xfa;car Awards, an awards show to recognize South Florida&#x2019;s gay talent. At one point, Marytrini struck a serious tone&#x2014;something she did regularly. She remembered a time when she was just imagining the possibility of this show, when they had just started performing at the then Concorde Supper Club. She recounted that at a dinner where she was not present, a friend had commented that he thought this venture was a very bad idea, that Marytrini was wasting her time because Miami was a very racist city. She paused the story to rub two fingers over her other forearm, a gesture commonly used in Miami to refer to or signal the presence of blacks. Her friend explained that Miami would never accept a black drag queen as the primary entertainment. Of course, dark-skinned drag queens (black Latinas and African Americans) had worked Miami&#x2019;s Latino clubs but typically performing supporting roles and interpreting the occasional Celia Cruz song&#x2014;never as emcee or reigning divas. Marytrini told the audience that this set of accomplishments, this show, and this celebration would show that friend that it could, in fact, be done.</p>
		<p>This is the kind of moment I looked for in my fieldwork. Part of me wanted to find Marytrini challenging racism, enacting blackness to challenge the inequalities that so permeate the common sense of Miami&#x2019;s Cuban community. However, Az&#xfa;car was not quite that comfortable, and this moment was more of an exception than a rule. More often, racism was hyperpresent, highly visible, invited, and enacted by Marytrini, and sometimes but not always it was subverted. The racial politics of Az&#xfa;car were complicated by the fact that the stripped-down and explicitly named racism could be delivered and received in different ways. Sometimes the audience seemed to participate in a celebration of racism, by laughing at the monkeys, for example. At other times, the laughter seemed to implicate racist whites and light-skinned Cuban Americans whose racism was revealed to be ridiculous, the butt of the joke. Moreover, the racism was also something that anyone living in Latin Miami long enough, regardless of his or her skin tone, would have experienced or participated in. Marytrini&#x2019;s show revealed the logic that drives many social and professional interactions&#x2014;a logic that views African Americans and the neighborhoods in which they live as dangerous but that views black Cubans with less fear than superficial and saccharin acceptance. The show also revealed the desire for blackness and the black desire for whiteness&#x2014;never in politically correct terms, of course.</p>
