At a time when\nsocial movements led by religious leaders, from Louis Farrakhan to Pat\nBuchanan, are playing a central role in American politics, James Darsey\nconnects this radical tradition with its prophetic roots.\n\nPublic discourse in the West is derived from the Greek principles of\ncivility, diplomacy, compromise, and negotiation. On this model, radical\nspeech is often taken to be a sympton of social disorder. Not so,\ncontends Darsey, who argues that the rhetoric of reform in America\nrepresents the continuation of a tradition separate from the commonly\naccepted principles of the Greeks.

At a time when social movements led by religious leaders, from Louis Farrakhan to Pat Buchanan, are playing a central role in American politics, James Darsey connects this radical tradition with its prophetic roots.</p><p>Public discourse in the West is derived from the Greek principles of civility, diplomacy, compromise, and negotiation. On this model, radical speech is often taken to be a sympton of social disorder. Not so, contends Darsey, who argues that the rhetoric of reform in America represents the continuation of a tradition separate from the commonly accepted principles of the Greeks. Though the links have gone unrecognized, the American radical tradition stems not from Aristotle, he maintains, but from the prophets of the Hebrew Bible.</p>",

        "description": "In 1971, Paul Harris pioneered the modern version of the black rage\ndefense when he successfully defended a young black man charged with\narmed bank robbery. Dubbed one of the most novel criminal defenses in\nAmerican history by Vanity Fair, the black rage defense is enormously\ncontroversial, frequently dismissed as irresponsible, nothing less than a\nharbinger of anarchy. Consider the firestorm of protest that resulted\nwhen the defense for Colin Ferguson, the gunman who murdered numerous\npassengers on a New York commuter train, claimed it was considering a\nblack rage defense.\n\nIn this thought-provoking book, Harris traces the origins of the black\nrage defense back through American history, recreating numerous dramatic\ntrials along the way. For example, he recounts in vivid detail how\nClarence Darrow, defense attorney in the famous Scopes Monkey trial,\nfirst introduced the notion of an environmental hardship defense in 1925\nwhile defending a black family who shot into a drunken white mob that had\nencircled their home.\n\nEmphasizing that the black rage defense must be enlisted responsibly and\nselectively, Harris skillfully distinguishes between applying an\nenvironmental defense and simply blaming society, in the abstract, for\nindividual crimes. If Ferguson had invoked such a defense, in Harris's\nwords, it would have sent a superficial, wrong-headed,\nblame-everything-on-racism message. Careful not to succumb to easy\ngeneralizations, Harris also addresses the possibilities of a white rage\ndefense and the more recent phenomenon of cultural defenses. He\nillustrates how a person's environment can, and does, affect his or her\nlife and actions, how even the most rational person can become criminally\nderanged, when bludgeoned into hopelessness by exploitation, racism, and\nrelentless poverty.\n",

Best known as an important Jewish\nscholar, he also held important rabbinic, teaching, and public positions.\nAlthough born and raised within an orthodox setting, Agus was strongly\ninfluenced by American liberalism and his work displayed modernizing\nsympathies, reservations about nationalism--including some forms of\nZionism--and often severe criticisms of kabbalah.

        "description_html": "\n<p>Rabbi Jacob Agus' (1911-1986) intellectual production spanned nearly a half century and covered an enormous historical and conceptual range, from the biblical to the modern era. Best known as an important Jewish scholar, he also held important rabbinic, teaching, and public positions. Although born and raised within an orthodox setting, Agus was strongly influenced by American liberalism and his work displayed modernizing sympathies, reservations about nationalism--including some forms of Zionism--and often severe criticisms of kabbalah. Agus crafted a unique, quite American, modernizing vision that ardently sought to remain in touch with the wellsprings of the rabbinic tradition while remaining open to the intellectual and moral currents of his own time.<p>The Essential Agus brings together a sampling of Agus' most important published and unpublished material in one easily accessible volume. It will be an invaluable resource for students and researchers seeking to experience Agus' intellectual legacy.</p>",

Rogers discusses theory in relation both to actual psychoanalytic case histories and imagined selves found in literature, and provides a critical rereading of the case histories of Freud, Winnicott, Lichtenstein, Sechehaye, and Bettelheim.</p> <p>At once scientific and humanistic, Self and Other engagingly draws from theoretical, clinical, and literary traditions. It will appeal to psychoanalysts as well as to literary scholars interested in the application of psychoanalysis to literature.</p>",

The Cold War has ended; yet Americans\nface daunting social and economic problems and are increasingly divided\nabout how to address them. In this perceptive psychological portrait of\nClinton and his presidency, expert Stanley Renshon investigates whether\nClinton has demonstrated the requisite qualities of judgment, vision,\ncharacter, and skill to meet the challenges he faces, domestically and\ninternationally, and whether he merits another term.\n\nRenshon incisively analyzes Clinton's sweeping ambitions, his enormous\nconfidence in himself and his goals, and his success in convincing people\nthat he genuinely cares about them. He reveals a Bill Clinton whose\ncapacity for political success is often undermined by the very traits for\nwhich many praise him. His unusually high self-confidence, for instance,\nleads him to believe that he can accomplish what others have not, that he\ncan, for instance, reconcile polar opposites such as liberal Democrats\nand conservative Republicans.

Russian history, religion, folklore,\nand literature are rife with suffering. The plight of Anna Karenina, the\nsubmissiveness of serfs in the 16th and 17th centuries, ancient religious\ntracts emphasizing humility as the mother of virtues, the trauma of the\nBolshevik revolution, the current economic upheavals wracking the\ncountry-- these are only a few of the symptoms of what The Slave Soul of\nRussia identifies as a veritable cult of suffering that has been\ncenturies in the making.\n\nBringing to light dozens of examples of self-defeating activities and\nbehaviors that have become an integral component of the Russian psyche,\nRancour-Laferriere convincingly illustrates how masochism has become a\nfact of everyday life in Russia. Until now, much attention has been paid\nto the psychology of Russia's leaders and their impact on the country's\ncondition. Here, for the first time, is a compelling portrait of the\nRussian people's psychology.\n",

The plight of Anna Karenina, the submissiveness of serfs in the 16th and 17th centuries, ancient religious tracts emphasizing humility as the mother of virtues, the trauma of the Bolshevik revolution, the current economic upheavals wracking the country-- these are only a few of the symptoms of what The Slave Soul of Russia identifies as a veritable cult of suffering that has been centuries in the making.</p> <p>Bringing to light dozens of examples of self-defeating activities and behaviors that have become an integral component of the Russian psyche, Rancour-Laferriere convincingly illustrates how masochism has become a fact of everyday life in Russia. Until now, much attention has been paid to the psychology of Russia's leaders and their impact on the country's condition. Here, for the first time, is a compelling portrait of the Russian people's psychology.</p>",

        "description": "In this unusual and much-needed reappraisal of Freud's clinical\ntechnique, M. Guy Thompson challenges the conventional notion that\npsychoanalysis promotes relief from suffering and replaces it with a more\nradical assertion, that psychoanalysis seeks to mend our relationship\nwith the real that has been fractured by our avoidance of the same.\nThompson suggests that, while avoiding reality may help to relieve our\nexperience of suffering, this short-term solution inevitably leads to a\nsplit in our existence.\n\nM. Guy Thompson forcefully disagrees with the recent trend that dismisses\nFreud as an historical figure who is out of step with the times. He\nargues, instead, for a return to the forgotten Freud, a man inherently\nphilosophical and rooted in a Greek preoccupation with the nature of\ntruth, ethics, the purpose of life and our relationship with reality.\nThompson's argument is situated in a stunning re-reading of Freud's\ntechnical papers, including a new evaluation of his analyses of Dora and\nthe Rat Man in the context of Heidegger's understanding of truth.\n\nIn this remarkable examination of Freud's technical recommendations, M.\nGuy Thompson explains how psychoanalysis was originally designed to\nre-acquaint us with realities we had abandoned by encountering them in\nthe contest of the analytic experience. This provocative examination of\nFreud's conception of psychoanalysis reveals a more personal Freud than\nwe had previously supposed, one that is more humanistic and real.\n",

Guy Thompson challenges the conventional notion that psychoanalysis promotes relief from suffering and replaces it with a more radical assertion, that psychoanalysis seeks to mend our relationship with the real that has been fractured by our avoidance of the same. Thompson suggests that, while avoiding reality may help to relieve our experience of suffering, this short-term solution inevitably leads to a split in our existence.</p> <p>M. Guy Thompson forcefully disagrees with the recent trend that dismisses Freud as an historical figure who is out of step with the times. He argues, instead, for a return to the forgotten Freud, a man inherently philosophical and rooted in a Greek preoccupation with the nature of truth, ethics, the purpose of life and our relationship with reality. Thompson's argument is situated in a stunning re-reading of Freud's technical papers, including a new evaluation of his analyses of Dora and the Rat Man in the context of Heidegger's understanding of truth.</p> <p>In this remarkable examination of Freud's technical recommendations, M. Guy Thompson explains how psychoanalysis was originally designed to re-acquaint us with realities we had abandoned by encountering them in the contest of the analytic experience. This provocative examination of Freud's conception of psychoanalysis reveals a more personal Freud than we had previously supposed, one that is more humanistic and real. </p>",
