Lawrence, Ben Jonson, George Orwell, and\nothers are the basis of this thoughtful exploration of the relationship\nbetween language and subject. Bringing together ideas from Freudian,\npost- Freudian, Lacanian, and post-structuralist schools, Alcorn\ninvestigates the power of the text that underlies the reader response\napproach to literature in a strikingly new way. He shows how the\nproduction of literary texts begins and ends with narcissistic self-love,\nand also shows how the reader's interest in these texts is directed by\nlibidinal investment.\nPsychoanalysts, psychologists, and lovers of literature will enjoy\nAlcorn's diverse and far-reaching insights into classic and contemporary\nwriters and thinkers.\n",
