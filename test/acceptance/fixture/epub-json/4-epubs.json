This book uses the\npsychoanalytic concepts of narcissism and libidinal investment to explain\nhow rhetoric compels us and how it can effect change.\n\nThe works of Joseph Conrad, James Baldwin, Michael Foucault, Jacques\nDerrida, Arthur Miller, D.H. Lawrence, Ben Jonson, George Orwell, and\nothers are the basis of this thoughtful exploration of the relationship\nbetween language and subject. Bringing together ideas from Freudian,\npost- Freudian, Lacanian, and post-structuralist schools, Alcorn\ninvestigates the power of the text that underlies the reader response\napproach to literature in a strikingly new way. He shows how the\nproduction of literary texts begins and ends with narcissistic self-love,\nand also shows how the reader's interest in these texts is directed by\nlibidinal investment.\nPsychoanalysts, psychologists, and lovers of literature will enjoy\nAlcorn's diverse and far-reaching insights into classic and contemporary\nwriters and thinkers.\n",
