   "description" : "Debate on public issues--and where candidates stand on them-- have\ntraditionally represented the focal point of presidential campaigns. In\nrecent decades, however, rather than asking where candidates stand on the\nissues, the public increasingly wants to know who they are. The issue of\ncharacter has thus come to dominate presidential elections.\n\nWhile there is increasing public awareness that the psychology, judgment,\nand leadership qualities of presidential candidates count, the basis on\nwhich these judgments should made remains unclear. Does it matter that\nGary Hart changed his name or had an affair? Should Ed Muskie's loss of\ncomposure while defending his wife during a campaign speech, or Thomas\nEagleton's hospitalization for depression, have counted against them?\n\nLooking back over the past 25 years, Stanley Renshon, a political\nscientist and psychoanalyst, provides the first comprehensive accounting\nof how character has become an increasingly important issue in a\npresidential campaign. He traces two related but distinctive approaches\nto the issue of presidential character and psychology. The first concerns\nthe mental health of our candidates and presidents. Are they emotionally\nand personally stable? Is their temperament suitable for the presidency?\nThe second concerns character. Is the candidate honest? Does he possess\nthe necessary judgment and motivation to deal with the tremendous\nresponsibilities and pressures of the office?\n\nDrawing on his clinical and political science training, Renshon has\ndevised a theory which will allow the public to better evaluate\npresidential candidates. Why are honesty, integrity, and personal ideals\nso important in judging candidates? Is personal and political ambition\nnecessarily a bad trait? Do extra-marital affairs really matter? Finally,\nand most importantly, how can the public tell whether a candidate's\nleadership will be enhanced or impeded by aspects of his personality?\n\nWith this sweeping volume, Stanley Renshon has provided us with the most\ncomprehensive account to date of how the public judges, and should judge,\nour future presidents.\n",
