   "description" : "In many arenas the debate is raging over the nature of sexual\norientation. Queer Words, Queer Images addresses this debate, but with a\ndifference, arguing that homosexuality has become an issue precisely\nbecause of the way in which we discuss, debate, and communicate about the\nconcept and experience of homosexuality. The debate over homosexuality is\nfundamentally an issue of communication-as we can see by the recent\ncontroversy over gays in the military.
