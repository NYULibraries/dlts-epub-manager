   "description" : "The insights here are of such depth, and contain such beauty in them,\nthat time and again the reader must pause for breath.

Kleinbard takes off where Hugo Simenauer's monumental\npsycho- biography of Rilke (1953) left off. . . .

Kleinbard goes on to explore Rilke's\npoetry, letters, and non-fiction prose, his childhood and marriage, and\nthe relationship between illness and genius in the poet and his work, a\nsubject to which Rilke returned time and again.\n\nThis psychoanalytic study also defines the complex connections between\nMalte's and Rilke's fantasies of mental and physical fragmentation, and\nthe poet's response to Rodin's disintegrative and re-integrative\nsculpture during the writing of The Notebooks and New Poems. One point of\ndeparture is the poet's sense of the origins of his illness in his\nchildhood and, particularly, in his mother's blind, narcissistic self-\nabsorption and his father's emotional constriction and mental\nlimitations. Kleinbard examines the poet's struggle to purge himself of\nhis deeply felt identification with his mother, even as he fulfilled her\nhopes that he become a major poet.
