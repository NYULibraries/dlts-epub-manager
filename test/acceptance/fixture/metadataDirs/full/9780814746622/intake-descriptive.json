   "description" : "Gulf War Syndrome: Is It a Real Disease? asks a recent headline in the\nNew York Times. This question-are certain diseases real?-lies at the\nheart of a simmering controversy in the United States, a debate that has\nraged, in different contexts, for centuries. In the early nineteenth\ncentury, the air of European cities, polluted by open sewers and\nindustrial waste, was generally thought to be the source of infection and\ndisease. Thus the term miasma-literally deathlike air-came into popular\nuse, only to be later dismissed as medically unsound by Louis Pasteur.\n\nWhile controversy has long swirled in the United States around such\nillnesses as chronic fatigue syndrome and Epstein-Barr virus, no disorder\nhas been more aggressively contested than environmental illness, a\ndisease whose symptoms are distinguished by an extreme, debilitating\nreaction to a seemingly ordinary environment. The environmentally ill\nrange from those who have adverse reactions to strong perfumes or\ncolognes to others who are so sensitive to chemicals of any kind that\nthey must retreat entirely from the modern world.\n\nBodies in Protest does not seek to answer the question of whether or not\nchemical sensitivity is physiological or psychological, rather, it\nreveals how ordinary people borrow the expert language of medicine to\nconstruct lay accounts of their misery.
