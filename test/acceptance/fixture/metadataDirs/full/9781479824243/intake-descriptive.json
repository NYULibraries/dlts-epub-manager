   "description" : "Do today’s youth have more opportunities than their parents? As they\nbuild their own social and digital networks, does that offer new routes\nto learning and friendship? How do they navigate the meaning of education\nin a digitally connected but fiercely competitive, highly individualized\nworld? Based upon fieldwork at an ordinary London school, The Class\nexamines young people's experiences of growing up and learning in a\ndigital world. In this original and engaging study, Livingstone and\nSefton-Green explore youth values, teenagers’ perspectives on their\nfutures, and their tactics for facing the opportunities and challenges\nthat lie ahead. The authors follow the students as they move across their\ndifferent social worlds—in school, at home, and with their friends,\nengaging in a range of activities from video games to drama clubs and\nmusic lessons. By portraying the texture of the students’ everyday lives,\nThe Class seeks to understand how the structures of social class and\ncultural capital shape the development of personal interests,\nrelationships and autonomy. Providing insights into how young people’s\nsocial, digital, and learning networks enable or disempower them,\nLivingstone and Sefton-Green reveal that the experience of disconnections\nand blocked pathways is often more common than that of connections and\nnew opportunities.\n",
