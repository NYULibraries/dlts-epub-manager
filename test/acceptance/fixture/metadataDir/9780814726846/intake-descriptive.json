   "description" : "Whether in the form of Christmas trees in town squares or prayer in\nschool, fierce disputes over the separation of church and state have long\nbedeviled this country. Both decried and celebrated, this principle is\nconsidered by many, for right or wrong, a defining aspect of American\nnational identity.\n\nNearly all discussions regarding the role of religion in American life\nbuild on two dominant assumptions: first, the separation of church and\nstate is a constitutional principle that promotes democracy and equally\nprotects the religious freedom of all Americans, especially religious\noutgroups; and second, this principle emerges as a uniquely American\ncontribution to political theory.\n\nIn Please Don't Wish Me a Merry Christmas, Stephen M. Feldman challenges\nboth these assumptions. He argues that the separation of church and state\nprimarily manifests and reinforces Christian domination in American\nsociety. Furthermore, Feldman reveals that the separation of church and\nstate did not first arise in the United States. Rather, it has slowly\nevolved as a political and religious development through western history,\nbeginning with the initial appearance of Christianity as it contentiously\nseparated from Judaism.\n\nIn tracing the historical roots of the separation of church and state\nwithin the Western world, Feldman begins with the Roman Empire and names\nAugustine as the first political theorist to suggest the idea. Feldman\nnext examines how the roles of church and state variously merged and\ndivided throughout history, during the Crusades, the Italian Renaissance,\nthe Protestant Reformation, the British Civil War and Restoration, the\nearly North American colonies, nineteenth-century America, and up to the\npresent day. In challenging the dominant story of the separation of\nchurch and state, Feldman interprets the development of Christian social\npower vis--vis the state and religious minorities, particularly the\nprototypical religious outgroup, Jews.\n",
