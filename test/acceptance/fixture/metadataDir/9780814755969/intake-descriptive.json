   "description" : "Many of us have grown up with the language of civil rights, yet rarely\nconsider how the construction of civil rights claims affects those who\nare trying to attain them. Diane Miller examines arguments lesbians and\ngay men make for civil rights, revealing the ways these arguments are\nboth progressive--in terms of helping to win court cases seeking basic\nhuman rights--and limiting--in terms of framing representations of gay\nmen and lesbians.\n\nMiller incorporates case studies of lesbians in the military and in\npolitics into her argument. She discusses in detail the experiences of\nColonel Margarethe Cammermeyer, who was dishonorably discharged from the\nNational Guard after 27 years of service when she revealed that she was a\nlesbian, and Roberta Achtenberg, who was nominated by Clinton for the job\nof Assistant Director of Housing and Urban Development and became the\nfirst gay or lesbian to face the confirmation process. Drawing on these\ncases and their outcomes, Miller evaluates the advantages and\ndisadvantages of privileging civil rights strategies in the struggle for\ngay and lesbian rights.\n",
