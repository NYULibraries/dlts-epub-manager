Journeying with the reader from the\ninception of labor unions through their heyday and to the present, Craver\nexamines the roots of their decline, the current factors which contribute\nto their dismal condition, and the actions that are needed--such as the\nrecruitment of female and minority employees and appeals to white-collar\npersonnel--that are necessary to ensure union viability in the 21st\ncentury.\n\nCraver thoughtfully discusses what labor organizations must do to\norganize new workers, to enhance their economic and political power, and\nto adapt to modern-day advances and to an increasingly global economy.
