   "description" : "What exactly is intelligence? Is it social achievement? Professional\nsuccess? Is it common sense? Or the number on an IQ test?\n\nInterweaving engaging narratives with dramatic case studies, Robert L.\nHayman, Jr., has written a history of intelligence that will forever\nchange the way we think about who is smart and who is not. To give weight\nto his assertion that intelligence is not simply an inherent\ncharacteristic but rather one which reflects the interests and\npredispositions of those doing the measuring, Hayman traces numerous\ncampaigns to classify human intelligence. His tour takes us through the\nearly craniometric movement, eugenics, the development of the IQ,\nSpearman's \"general\" intelligence, and more recent works claiming a\ngenetic basis for intelligence differences.\n\nWhat Hayman uncovers is the maddening irony of intelligence: that\n\"scientific\" efforts to reduce intelligence to a single, ordinal quantity\nhave persisted--and at times captured our cultural imagination--not\nbecause of their scientific legitimacy, but because of their longstanding\npolitical appeal. The belief in a natural intellectual order was\npervasive in \"scientific\" and \"political\" thought both at the founding of\nthe Republic and throughout its nineteenth-century Reconstruction. And\nwhile we are today formally committed to the notion of equality under the\nlaw, our culture retains its central belief in the natural inequality of\nits members. Consequently, Hayman argues, the promise of a genuine\nequality can be realized only when the mythology of \"intelligence\" is\ndebunked--only, that is, when we recognize the decisive role of culture\nin defining intelligence and creating intelligence differences. Only\nculture can give meaning to the statement that one person-- or one\ngroup--is smarter than another. And only culture can provide our\nmotivation for saying it.\n\nWith a keen wit and a sharp eye, Hayman highlights the inescapable\ncontradictions that arise in a society committed both to liberty and to\nequality and traces how the resulting tensions manifest themselves in the\nways we conceive of identity, community, and merit.\n",
