    <p class="pf"><i>Modern Times</i> and <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> demonstrate that there was a broader awareness of the politics surrounding communicative norms during the modernist period than is generally recognized. Both texts dramatize the kinds of regulatory pressure and even corporal punishment inflicted through both official and unofficial channels on individuals who failed to conform. This policing of communicative difference in social situations sits in sharp contrast to the reactions toward linguistic experimentation in the work of many of Anderson’s and Chaplin’s contemporaries who deliberately broke with convention in the pursuit of an aesthetic of difficulty. It is only fairly recently that such “high” modernist techniques have been registered as socially engaged, and when these discussions have occurred, they have almost always been perceived as unrelated to accounts of language use in individuals and communities deemed “disabled.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en259" id="en259r">1</a> Recognizing the privileged position required to engage in aesthetic experiments without fear of corporeal reprisals (receiving a negative critical review is, after all, a very different experience than being institutionalized and physically forced to use language normatively) is key to recovering the context in which both aesthetic and pragmatic practices of nonstandard language emerged in the early twentieth century.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en260" id="en260r">2</a></p>

    <p>In broad terms, modernist linguistic experimentation needs to be understood as part of a larger quilt of related (though often cognitively dissonant) developments in language politics. The visual and physical languages of the Deaf also contribute more specific insight into how we analyze two of the most frequently discussed elements of modernist difficulty: <a class="page" id="p92"></a>juxtaposition and indeterminacy. This context helpfully brings to the fore the (often suppressed or unrecognized) resonances that written experiments have with embodiment. In making these links through manual languages back to the body, it is my aim to present a complex picture of the ways we might think through the relationship between modernist artistic practices and corporeality that push beyond the common narrative of linguistic fragmentation responding to a combination of the literal breaking of bodies in the trenches of the First World War and the alienated modern psychology that developed out of that shared trauma.</p>

    <p>As the dominant narrative goes, in combination with rapid developments in technology—particularly those in medical technology that grew out of a need to treat wounded veterans—this fragmentation led to an interest in the “broken” body. In <i>Modernism, Technology and the Body</i>, Tim Armstrong argues, “modernist texts have a particular fascination with the limits of the body, either in terms of its mechanical functioning, its energy levels, or its abilities as a perceptual system.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en261" id="en261r">3</a> While these texts were inspired by actual bodies and literal limits, however, the ways in which wounded soldiers and civilians were appropriated into modern philosophy and aesthetics quickly moved to the kind of narrative prostheses that David T. Mitchell and Sharon L. Snyder have demonstrated deploy the disabled body as cipher. In the context of an aesthetic of fragmentation, these (often newly) disabled bodies became the cultural symbol of the alienated, fragmented state that many artists associated with modernity itself.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en262" id="en262r">4</a></p>

    <p>In other words, both modernism and modernist criticism have frequently made use of the disabled body in the service of aesthetics but have failed either to account for the lived realities of such bodies or to capitalize on the disability insight of individuals whose bodily abilities were impacted by the war but who may well not have understood their new embodiments in the terms dictated by the criticism. The problem of colonizing the disabled body as symbol is that it provides a set of expectations (of brokenness, lack, deprivation, limit) that make it difficult to recognize the more creative conversations opened up by a crip epistemology. In this chapter, I want to move away from the standard representation of the modern disabled body as fragmented by pushing the conversation onto this more productive cripistemic ground and exploring what the linguistics of American Sign Language reveal about that most culturally valued of modernist traits: difficulty. Specifically, ASL linguistics gives us new ways of thinking about two of the key components of modernist difficulty—juxtaposition and indeterminacy—and of recognizing the links between <a class="page" id="p93"></a>these qualities and the body. In some cases, this context helps explain heretofore undervalued and misunderstood references to embodiment in difficult modernism, and in others, it makes us sensitive to the meaningful absences of bodies within difficult texts.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0401">What Is Difficult about Modernist Difficulty?</h2>

    <p class="paft">The idea of difficult art works is, of course, not a uniquely modern one. What distinguished early twentieth-century texts was the way writers turned difficulty itself into an aesthetically valued category, as opposed to a byproduct of their work. In “The Metaphysical Poets,” T.&nbsp;S. Eliot claimed difficulty as a defining characteristic of modern art that emerged directly from encounters with modernity: “It appears likely that poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be <i>difficult</i>. Our civilization comprehends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results. The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en263" id="en263r">5</a> To do this, Eliot imagined that the process through which words signified needed to be reconsidered, dislocated through techniques such as juxtaposition and collage not only into new meanings but into new ways of meaning.</p>

    <p>This fascination with deliberate difficulty was not restricted to Eliot or even just his poetic circle. As Leonard Diepeveen notes in <i>The Difficulties of Modernism</i>, around 1915 there was a shift in the application of “difficulty” as a descriptor. Whereas before it had primarily functioned as a critique of individual authors, now it was seen as characteristic of an entire cultural and artistic movement, a necessarily widespread response to the “variety and complexity” of “our civilization.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en264" id="en264r">6</a> The details of how this difficulty was enacted varied from text to text, but across these different flavors, juxtaposition and indeterminacy emerged as common threads that seemed to present specifically modernist interpretations of what it meant for works to be challenging. Perhaps no example illustrates this quite as neatly as the epigraphs from Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land</i>. As I discussed in chapter 1, almost immediately upon its publication in 1922, <i>The Waste Land</i> came to serve as a representation of (and, therefore, often a straw man in arguments about) difficult modernism. In the space of just a few lines, and before the poem formally begins, the epigraphs enact both of these modes of difficulty, as well as demonstrating how the two could interact.</p>

    <p><a class="page" id="p94"></a>In contradistinction to the explosion of mass-market popular works that were perceived to be accessible, texts associated with high modernism frequently incorporated archaic knowledge that harked back to a classical education that the majority of people did not possess. <i>The Waste Land</i> plays on this dynamic by opening in untranslated Latin and Greek from the <i>Satyricon</i>: “Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: Σίβυλλα τί θέλεις; respondebat illa: ἀποθανεῑν θέλω.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en265" id="en265r">7</a> While it has become a critical commonplace to challenge the rigid separation between popular and elitist culture—what Andreas Huyssen terms “the Great Divide”—barriers to general accessibility were a significant part of high modernist aesthetics, even when they were treated with a certain degree of sarcasm by their writers.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en266" id="en266r">8</a> The unattributed lines present the reader with an immediate challenge, a barrier of multiple classical languages suggesting a particular level of erudition necessary to work through the poem. Layered on top of this is the difficulty of negotiating the unexpected juxtaposition of the ancient with the modern. Even before its publication, <i>The Waste Land</i> was marketed as the quintessential modernist poem, a uniquely modernist view of a uniquely modern world. To get to the portrayal of that hypermodernity, however, these lines force the reader to first negotiate the ancient.</p>

    <p>The poem’s second epigraph—“For Ezra Pound <i>il miglior fabbro</i>”—introduces another aspect of modernist juxtaposition: the movement between public and private references and knowledge. Understanding the line demands translation—“the better craftsman”—as well as a recognition of the allusion to canto 26 of Dante’s <i>Purgatorio</i>, in which the poet Guido Guinizelli (the first to write in <i>Dolce Stil Novo</i>, the “sweet new style” of which Dante was a disciple) praises Arnaut Daniel, a twelfth-century troubadour whose excellence Pound had described at length in his 1910 <i>The Spirit of Romance</i>.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en267" id="en267r">9</a> For the reference to make sense, we need not only to know our Dante but also to have personal information about Pound, his relationship to Eliot, and his role in editing <i>The Waste Land</i>.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en268" id="en268r">10</a></p>

    <p>The epigraphs build on this juxtaposition of personal and scholarly references to create webs of interlocking meanings. Juxtaposition itself, described as deriving from both the fragmentary nature of modern life and experiments with montage in the cinema, contributes to the challenge of reading the poem by continually destabilizing the frame of reference. Like the movement between scholarly and personal registers, the shift between “high” and “low” culture—the incorporation of scenes from music halls, the use of dialect, the movement between classical Latin referents and contemporary scenes of bad sex, to list just some of <a class="page" id="p95"></a>the examples present in the body of the poem<i>—</i>contributes to the instability, the difficulty for the reader of working out what is significant.</p>

    <p>That question of what (if anything) is to be taken seriously in the process of reading the text leads to the second mode of difficulty I want to discuss: indeterminacy. In <i>The Poetics of Indeterminacy</i> (1981), Marjorie Perloff memorably describes allusive chains of the possibly meaningful that we see in poems such as <i>The Waste Land</i> as “reverberating echo chamber[s] of meaning,” in which “the symbolic evocations generated by words on the page are no longer grounded in a coherent discourse, so that it becomes impossible to decide which of these associations are relevant and which are not.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en269" id="en269r">11</a> In addition to the destabilization of juxtaposition, readers are faced with the unsettling notion that even if they work out possible relationships between the register-jumping “pearls that were his eyes” and “that Shakespeherian rag” in “A Game of Chess,” for example, there is no guarantee that the resonances that appear for them are “correct,” that there is a “correct” reading of this particular poem, or that there are “correct” readings of anything at all. Eliot’s contemporary Hart Crane provided an explicit defense of this kind of apparent obscurity in a letter to Harriet Monroe, in which he argued, “as a poet I may very possibly be more interested in the so-called illogical impingements of the connotations of words on the consciousness (and their combinations and interplay in metaphor on this basis) than I am interested in the preservation of their logically rigid significations.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en270" id="en270r">12</a> Preserving “logically rigid significations,” making conventional sense, both Crane’s and Eliot’s work suggests, was decidedly not the goal of modernist poetics.</p>

    <p>While interpretive dead ends are, again, not unique to this historical moment, the level to which their creative process self-reflexively called into question the very reading practices that had traditionally been employed to provide meaning was something new. This nihilism of interpretation has often been linked to the nihilism that many readers take away from the poem’s vision of the modern world as they scramble furiously and sometimes futilely with fragments that refuse to cohere. That Eliot seems to be engaged in a kind of game—particularly in his use of a scholarly apparatus that refuses definitive resolution to an even greater degree than the text itself—has not undermined the general consensus that the poem’s meaning is that there is no meaning, that it is the condition of the modern world to refuse truth or understanding.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en271" id="en271r">13</a> The poem both thematically points toward and structurally enacts this fundamental indeterminacy.</p>

    <p>Despite the ways that New Criticism—with its emphasis on close readings of the text alone, divorced from authorial and readerly <a class="page" id="p96"></a>bodies—developed out of critical work by Eliot, who also helped establish the institutional hold of the approach, such difficulty actually did promote an unexpected engagement with embodied subjects: specifically, those of readers. In line with the appearance of bodies in unexpected places, which I discuss toward the end of the chapter, the ways in which readers (and critics) have responded to juxtaposition and indeterminacy are often described in decidedly visceral ways. Through surprising juxtapositions and a withholding of explanation, readers committed to making meaning out of difficult modernist texts must fill in the gaps in whatever ways their own knowledge or backgrounds allow. One of the pragmatic consequences of such difficulty, that is, is the development of an intensely personal, and even physical, relationship between reader and text.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en272" id="en272r">14</a> As Diepeveen argues, “Difficulty is an odd aesthetic experience; using their whole bodies, people react viscerally to difficulty, often with anxiety, anger, and ridicule. The public debate about difficulty and its scandalousness, then, was much more than a story of elitism and middle-class anti-intellectualism. It was also a story of anger, of pleasure, and of the body.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en273" id="en273r">15</a> By demanding new kinds of reading practices, difficult modernist texts engaged the bodies of readers in new and often uncomfortable ways. Through their relation to readers, even those texts considered the most indeterminate linked up with (and were dependent for their meanings on) concretely embodied subjects. As I will demonstrate, ASL linguistics reveals even more unexpected ways in which difficulty leads us back to the body.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0402">Linguistic Simultaneity</h2>

    <p class="paft">One of the reasons both juxtaposition and indeterminacy are uncomfortable for many readers is that they challenge the linear progression either from one idea logically to the next or via a deductive reasoning process that involves collecting pieces of evidence as one moves forward through a text toward an interpretation. This sense of linear progress is deeply connected to the structure of language itself in ways that became an explicit part of linguistic discourse at precisely the same time that modernist writers began challenging the coherence of the poetic line.</p>

    <p>Conventional spoken and written languages, those that difficult modernist writing aimed to complicate, are necessarily linear. Indeed, as Ferdinand de Saussure argues in his <i>Course on General Linguistics</i>, a text that came to shape much of twentieth-century literary criticism’s attitudes toward language through its role in the development of structural linguistics, linearity (along with arbitrariness) is an essential quality of <a class="page" id="p97"></a>language.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en274" id="en274r">16</a> As Saussure put it, “the signifier, being auditory, is unfolded solely in time from which it gets the following characteristics: (a) it represents a span, and (b) the span is measurable in a single dimension; it is a line.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en275" id="en275r">17</a> While the apparent simplicity of the assertion had caused many people to overlook it, Saussure argues that this linearity “is fundamental, and its consequences are incalculable. Its importance equals that of Principle I [the arbitrary nature of the sign]; the whole mechanism of language depends on it. . . . In contrast to visual signifiers (nautical signals, etc.) which can offer simultaneous groupings in several dimensions, auditory signifiers have at their command only the dimension of time. Their elements are presented in succession; they form a chain.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en276" id="en276r">18</a> Although Saussure mistakenly dismisses the possibility of languages in the visual mode, his analysis significantly identifies “visual signifiers” as possessing “simultaneous groupings in several dimensions,” which he contrasts with the linear unfolding of auditory language (as well as systems of written language based on them).<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en277" id="en277r">19</a></p>

    <p>The linearity that Saussure identifies with spoken and written language occurs at both phonetic and syntactic levels; letters and sounds must proceed one after another in order for an utterance to make sense within words, and words in sentences must likewise appear in a fairly rigid order for sentences to have meaning. To either verbally articulate or write the word “dog,” for example, the letters or sounds for each phoneme must appear in a particular, sequential order. Any change to this sequence (odg, ogd, gdo, god, dgo) results in either nonsense or a separate signifier. Alteration to that temporal unfolding (attempting to produce the letters or phonemes simultaneously) also fails to produce semantic meaning.</p>

    <p>Similarly, words within a sentence, while they can sometimes be placed in different orders, must nevertheless unfold in a single dimension. The reasons for this linearity derive from the channels through which such languages are both produced and received. While signed languages deploy a variety of articulators—hands, arms, torso, face, mouth, eyebrows—which can signify independently of one another, the production of spoken language involves the interdependent apparatus of the throat.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en278" id="en278r">20</a> It is not physiologically possible to express multiple linguistic messages simultaneously through the same apparatus. Similar structural limitations impact the receptive abilities of listeners processing language aurally; strenuous effort is required to attempt to decode overlapping linguistic messages, and such efforts usually result in failure.</p>

    <p>Just as linearity is an essential feature of meaning production in spoken and written language, simultaneity is central to the way that signed <a class="page" id="p98"></a>languages function. The human visual system—that is, the system through which signed languages are most typically processed—is decidedly more adept at decoding multiple messages simultaneously.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en279" id="en279r">21</a> As the linguists Howard Poizner, Edward Klima, and Ursula Bellugi note, “Rather than relying primarily on the order of items and fine temporal processing, sign language is organized in co-occurring layers and requires the processing of spatial relations.” This “multilayering of linguistic elements is a pervasive structural principle.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en280" id="en280r">22</a> As Saussure suggested, that is, visual languages are indeed multilayered and able to function in multiple dimensions. And these qualities have a significant impact on the ways signed languages function, particularly in the options they have for encoding information in words.</p>

    <p>What is perhaps most significant about this analysis is the relationship it establishes between the spatial capabilities of signed languages (“multilayering,” “spatial relations”) and their implications for temporality, a relationship I explore in more detail in chapter 4. Where other forms of language progress horizontally, the (vertical) layering of information onto individual signs enables a rich use of simultaneity. Rather than strings of information unfolding on the horizontal axis, signs can encode linguistic information in “multilayered” bundles that are stacked vertically.</p>

    <p>As Margalit Fox suggests in <i>Talking Hands</i>, this simultaneity results from both the ability of signers to produce multiple linguistic messages at the same time and the ability of viewers to decode them: “Because the human visual system is better than the auditory system at processing simultaneous information, a language in the visual mode can exploit this potential and encode its signals <i>simultaneously</i>. This is exactly what all signed languages do. Whereas words are linear strings, signs are compact bundles of data, in which multiple units of code—handshape, location, and movement—are conveyed in virtually the same moment.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en281" id="en281r">23</a> This simultaneity results in part from the way morphology functions in signed languages. To change the root sign “look at” to “watch,” “stare,” or “look at for a long time,” for example, the modifications are stacked on top of the original sign, and they take place in the same temporal moment. As opposed to unfolding over time, “complex signs are formed from simple ones by altering the spatial signal <i>while the simple sign is being made</i>. . . . ASL can . . . expand simple words . . . into elaborate matrixes of related meanings.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en282" id="en282r">24</a> One example of such layering in ASL is the group of signs that the ASL linguist Carol Padden refers to as “agreeing” or directional signs. Included in this group are words such as “give,” “help,” “ask,” and “hate.” Encoded within these signs is information regarding subject and object; the signs move through space from <a class="page" id="p99"></a>the former to the latter.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en283" id="en283r">25</a> Some signs—“send,” for example—can also be encoded with information regarding the nature of the sending, its exhaustive distributional aspect (send to each) and its iterative aspect (send repeatedly); the sign can be altered to mean to send to one person, to send to all people in a group, to send many times to one person, to send many times to each person in a group, and so on.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en284" id="en284r">26</a> Unlike English, which appends information with additional words, prefixes, or suffixes in a horizontal chain (“house” becomes “houses,” “done” becomes “undone, “send” becomes “send to me,” etc.), ASL often layers this data onto the original sign. So with a single sign, one can indicate the concept “I sent repeatedly to each person,” a phrase that is cumbersome and awkward (as well as horizontally extended) in English. Or, as figure 3.1 illustrates, information regarding a word’s temporal aspect can be layered onto an original sign, so that the messages “study continually,” “study regularly,” “study for prolonged period,” “study over and over again,” and “study in a hurry” can all be expressed with vertical alterations to a single sign.</p>

    <p>Some of the other places we see this vertical layering most dramatically in ASL are adverbs and negation. American Sign Language does not have adverbs that occur as separate signs. Rather, the information that would be provided through the addition of an adverb to a verbal string of words is stacked on top of the sign for the verb itself. In ASL, there are eleven kinds of adverbials communicated through the face.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en285" id="en285r">27</a> For example,</p>

    <div class="senseline">
      <p class="slf">Face:&nbsp;____________/<i>mm</i>/_______</p>

      <p class="sl">Hands: Her husband cook-[dur] dinner</p>

      <p class="sll">“Her husband has been cooking the dinner with pleasure.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en286" id="en286r">28</a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">Here, the “mm” represents a facial expression (nonmanual signifier) that expresses the adverbial phrase “with pleasure.” As this rendering of the translation indicates, the information is stacked on top of the signs, rather than unfolding horizontally, and grammatical information is communicated through various parts of the body.</p>

    <p>Negation in ASL functions similarly. The phrase “Mary is not buying a car,” for example, would be signed as follows:</p>

    <div class="senseline">
      <p class="slf">Face:&nbsp;_____<i>/neg/____________</i></p>

      <p class="sl">Hands: Mary buy car</p>

      <p class="sll">“Mary is not buying a car.”</p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">Here, the negation (communicated through a head shake) continues throughout the entire verb phrase. Again, the information is expressed simultaneously rather than sequentially.</p>

    </div>

    <p><a class="page"></a>In the next section, I tease out some of the ways we might think about this vertical stacking in relation to indeterminacy in the work of Hart Crane. Before doing so, however, I want to address the way in which another form of simultaneity in signed languages might contribute to discussions of juxtaposition. In addition to possessing this inherent layering potential, signed languages also have the ability to transmit multiple messages simultaneously through separate articulators. This is most apparent in the deployment of the two hands to express distinct messages. One hand might reinforce the message expressed by the other, contradict it, or complicate it. The Deaf American poet and linguist Clayton Valli’s “Tears of Life” is structured around precisely this <a class="page" id="p101"></a>relationship. In it, the poet creates a rhythm by alternating between one and two signs.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en287" id="en287r">29</a> The right hand tells the narrative of a life, as an individual grows up, marries, has a child, and dies. The other hand repeats the sign “tear” by moving downward across the cheek and then back up in a loop that recalls Gertrude Stein’s claim that there is no such thing as repetition: “a rose is a rose is a rose.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en288" id="en288r">30</a> Each time the cycle is repeated, the meaning of the sign changes as it interacts with the various events being recounted (tears of sorrow at death, joy at births, etc.). Each hand articulates separate linguistic content that is given new meaning when the two are read together.</p>

    <p>Through this juxtaposition of meanings, “Tears of Life” enacts the speculation of W.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;T. Mitchell, put forward in the introduction to the first book-length collection of essays on ASL literature, that “one could imagine a bilingual performance in which speech and gesture had a contrapuntal or even contradictory, ironic relationship.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en289" id="en289r">31</a> Among other things, this relationship can signal the discomfort of moving between cultures, languages, or worldviews that I suggested was behind the experimental language use in “Salt in the Basement.” Even more significantly, however, is the way the text links this sliding signifier (produced through juxtaposition) to the vertical axis—the tear moving upward and downward on the signer’s cheek, in contrast to the horizontally, temporally unfolding life events taking place on the right hand. Despite the apparent simplicity of “Tears of Life,” the poem provides metacommentary on the function of both indeterminacy (vertical layering) and juxtaposition (through its use of the two hands to express distinct linguistic messages). Moreover, it situates this commentary in explicit relation to its thematic consideration of human subjects.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0403">New Thresholds, New Anatomies</h2>

    <p class="paft">The poet Hart Crane was similarly intrigued by the notion that bodies possess extrasignificatory potential to stack additional information onto words.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en290" id="en290r">32</a> As I highlighted in responses to Sherwood Anderson, as well as in R.&nbsp;P. Blackmur’s contradictory engagements with the body, such explicit treatment of embodied subjectivity within modernist works was often viewed as regressive, as unproductively out of step with modernity. And this perception has also shaped the reception of Crane’s experiments at the conceptual intersection of words, images, and bodies. Though he worked during the same period, publishing collections of poetry in 1926 and 1930, Crane’s writing never fit comfortably with the <a class="page" id="p102"></a>high modernism of his generation. Unlike (and in response to) the sparse language and cynicism of many of his contemporaries, Crane’s lyrics are decadent and romantic, overflowing with emotion. Crane unabashedly viewed himself as inheritor of an ecstatic tradition of prophesy to which he hoped his poems could contribute. As Eliza New described, “Hart Crane is the American poet of Awe.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en291" id="en291r">33</a> While his verse shared with writers such as Eliot and Pound an intense difficulty, it was a difficulty not arising primarily from webs of erudite and encyclopedic references but rather growing out of Crane’s attempts to imagine alternative modes of communication that might bring about new ways of knowing.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en292" id="en292r">34</a></p>

    <p>Given how different Crane’s fervent belief in the metaphysical potential of poetic language was from most of his peers, it is unsurprising that his work was often met with a great deal of skepticism. While Crane was praised, both during his short career and since, as immensely talented—Harold Bloom described his poetic gifts as surpassing “those even of Whitman, Dickinson, Eliot, Frost, Stevens”—it is almost always with a caveat.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en293" id="en293r">35</a> The most abiding ideas in criticism of Crane for a very long time were that his poetic ambitions were ultimately a “splendid failure,” as the title of Edward Brunner’s 1985 book puts it, that he was, in R.&nbsp;P. Blackmur’s words, a “distraught but exciting splendor of a great failure,” and that this “poetics of failure” was directly linked with the poet’s 1932 death at sea, presumed a suicide.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en294" id="en294r">36</a> Joseph Riddel, writing of one of Crane’s last published poems, “The Broken Tower,” exemplifies this strand of argument, describing the work as dramatizing “once and for all in our time, the pathetic gesture of a man dying into his work. In other words, it seems to do just what Crane’s life was dedicated to—it turns the self into a poem.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en295" id="en295r">37</a></p>

    <p>While critical appraisals have moved somewhat away from describing Crane as a failure, the idea that some sections of Crane’s poems are much more successful than others, and that this incomplete success directly contributed to Crane’s personal difficulties, remains a commonplace. Part of the impetus to collapse Crane’s marginalized—depressed, alcoholic, and gay—body with his poetry, despite decades of critical training schooling us to be cautious of these kinds of moves, stems, as I suggested earlier, from the writer’s own approach to the relationship between bodies and language. Some of the aspects of Crane’s work that have been read as failing resulted precisely from his experimentation with the boundaries between the physical and the written, features that more recent linguistic analysis of actual embodied (signed) languages reveal as necessary components of physical language.</p>

    <p><a class="page" id="p103"></a>In “General Aims and Theories,” an essay in which Crane lays out his poetic method, he describes his attempt to create “a new <i>word</i>, never before spoken and impossible to actually enunciate.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en296" id="en296r">38</a> For Crane, such words were impossible to enunciate because they were not verbally articulated but rather expressed in other ways. His description of this language as “genetic” and “organic” and his insistence that “new conditions of life germinate new forms of spiritual articulation” highlight the connection Crane identified between the kind of poetry he sought to write and the physical.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en297" id="en297r">39</a> Crane references the link between language and bodies throughout his work, including the two figures from my section title: the “new thresholds, new anatomies!” he imagines in “The Wine Menagerie” and the “signature of the incarnate word” that appears in “Voyages.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en298" id="en298r">40</a> The second of these, like the “livid hieroglyph” from “At Melville’s Tomb,” connects Crane’s ideas about living language to writing and signal his desire to in some way represent ideas he associated with such language on the page.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en299" id="en299r">41</a></p>

    <p>Crane linked physical language with what he describes as “the organic principle of a ‘logic of metaphor’” that served as the basis of his writing and that required readers to become involved in the production of meaning by deriving “the implicit emotional dynamics of the materials used,” which were “selected . . . for their associational meanings.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en300" id="en300r">42</a> As opposed to what Crane calls “ordinary logic” in the apology for his work sent to Harriet Monroe, this “genetic basis of all speech” involves a layering of meanings on top of one another.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en301" id="en301r">43</a> While Crane (in a fabulous example of understatement) fully admits that readers often find “certain initial difficulties in understanding” his poems, he maintains that this kind of overlapping (and nonlogical) web of associations allows him to go “through” language and access a deeper meaning, the “crystal Word” he describes in “The Broken Tower” or the “Imaged word” at the end of “Voyages.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en302" id="en302r">44</a></p>

    <p>In “Voyages,” a six-part poem composed between 1921 and 1926, Crane explores the significance of these embodied words. Drawing on the influence of Walt Whitman, the work is an extended meditation on the intersection of languages, bodies, and love. Parts of the poem were inspired by his relationship with the merchant seaman Emil Opffer. In a letter to Waldo Frank describing his love, Crane declares, “I have seen the Word made Flesh. I mean nothing less, and I know now that there is such a thing as indestructibility.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en303" id="en303r">45</a> This idea of what it might mean to have a written word made flesh (or flesh made written word) provides an insight into one way of interpreting the poem.</p>

    <p>The first section of “Voyages” establishes the problem of meaningful communication. Standing on a beach, the speaker observes children <a class="page" id="p104"></a>playing and ponders how to express to them the sense of profound danger he feels at the edge of the sea.</p>

    <div class="senseline">
      <p class="slf">Bright striped urchins flay each other with sand.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="pcon">As readers of Crane’s poetry might immediately notice, this poem provides us with some uncharacteristic anchors; we have a recognizable setting (the beach), characters (the speaker, the children, and their dog), several end-stopped lines, and even sentences that contain easily identifiable subjects and verbs (none of which are features Crane is known for). This perception of readability, however, is part of the point made by situating this section (which was originally written as a separate poem several years earlier) within the context of the rest of the piece. The speaker here is stymied, unable to express his concerns. As Evelyn J. Hintz notes, “The child’s mode of communication is alogical and nonsyntactical. . . . To tell them one would have to speak their language.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en305" id="en305r">47</a> In the first section of the poem, the speaker is unable to do this, unable to get beyond linear speech, and it is this frustrated communication that creates the need for the remaining five sections.</p>

    <p>The opening stanza of “Voyages II” directly responds to the final line of the first (the bottom of the sea is cruel), firmly linking them, but the shift in style is immediately apparent.</p>

    <div class="senseline">
      <p class="slf">—And yet this great wink of eternity,</p>

      <p class="sl">Samite sheeted and processioned where</p>

      <p class="sl">Her undinal vast belly moonward bends</p>

      <p class="sll">Laughing the wrapt inflections of our love;<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en306" id="en306r">48</a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">In the contemporary world, some measure of a poem’s shift into linguistic experimentation is marked by the place at which the spell-check function on one’s word processor goes into overdrive. For “Voyages,” this is that place. Both the diction and the syntax become more <a class="page" id="p105"></a>convoluted—Harold Bloom describes it as “even more elliptical . . . than Crane’s usual <i>praxis</i>”—as the poet experiments with an alternative kind of language that might overcome the difficulties of the previous section and access a transcendent meaning, the “paradise” the speaker refers to in the section’s final line: “The seal’s wide spindrift gaze toward paradise.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en307" id="en307r">49</a></p>

    <p>As Crane suggests in his critical writing, the logic of his poems is associative; its orgiastic overflow of associations recalls Perloff’s description of indeterminate poems as “reverberating echo chamber[s] of meaning.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en308" id="en308r">50</a> The opening image of the sea as a “wink of eternity” both provides one of Crane’s characteristic counterintuitive word pairings (the sea as simultaneously bounded in time and infinite) and links this paradoxical language to the body (wink). The next two lines play with the contradiction; in the second, we have images of the infinite, the “rimless floods” and unconstrained or unshackled movements leeward, away from the wind. In the third, by contrast, the sea is described as bounded, samite sheeted, wrapped in rich silk fabric, associated with death (a theme that will be played on throughout the poem), and processing in a confined, orderly fashion. “Sheeted” also refers to sails, linking up with the nautical reference in “leewardings.”</p>

    <p>It is at the location where the sea is constrained that the speaker comes into contact with it. Here, the sea’s vast belly bends toward the moon, laughing the wrapt inflections of the love between the speaker and another who is introduced simply by the pronoun “our,” a kind of absent presence. In the stanza’s last two lines, we again have a tension between constraint and release. The belly curving toward the sky seems at first an image of freedom, but hidden within “bends” is an association with confinement, with forcing an object from a straight form to a curved one, as in the bending of bow strings.</p>

    <p>“Laughing the wrapt inflections of our love” allows for the sea laughing at the lovers or somehow bringing their relationship into existence through the laughter. The laughing also resonates aurally with the lapping of the waves. “Wrapt inflections” overlays “rapt”—affected with rapture or transported to a state of bliss—with the force of being wrapped up, concealed, or hidden (a particularly loaded set of associations for those who want to read Crane’s work biographically). Individual words here function as entire stories, entire poems in themselves. Inflections brings us back to the idea of bending, as well as to verbal inflections (inflections in tone), once again signaling the body. This play on inflections returns in the section’s fourth stanza, where the “gliding shoulders” of a previous <a class="page" id="p106"></a>draft was changed to “turning shoulders” so that the line in the final version reads, “mark how her turning shoulders wind the hours.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en309" id="en309r">51</a> Turning ties us through bending back to inflections and the link between embodiment and communication between the sea and the speaker. It is, significantly, the sea’s belly that is the subject to which the verb “laughs” is attached.</p>

    <p>This conceptual pairing occurs again in the stanza when the lover is encouraged to “hasten while her penniless rich palms / Pass superscription of bent foam and wave.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en310" id="en310r">52</a> “Pass” here suggests both “pass along” (communicate) as well as “move beyond,” and it is her palms that do the passing. The content of that communication, the knowledge of “bent foam and wave,” again recalls inflections (bent) and binds the speaker and the sea in a communicative exchange. The deeper, secret knowledge that the speaker seeks to access is directly associated with embodiment in the third stanza, when the speaker exhorts his lover, “O my Prodigal,” to “Complete the dark confessions her veins spell.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en311" id="en311r">53</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the rest of the poem, Crane continues to associate embodied language both with access to a kind of understanding not possible with conventional communication and with a proliferation of meaning. In “Voyages IV,” the speaker describes the sea’s “Portending eyes and lips . . . making told / The chancel port and portion of our June,” body parts again communicating information about the intense love affair (the experience of “our June”) through a series of interlocking and overlapping religious and nautical images.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en312" id="en312r">54</a> Later, the speaker explains that “In signature of the incarnate word / The harbor shoulders to resign in mingling / Mutual blood, transpiring as foreknown,” linking this new kind of communication with writing (and, by extension, with Crane’s own project).<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en313" id="en313r">55</a> In the final section of the poem, Crane associates “dialogue with eyes”—an image that already suggests at least two speakers or perspectives—with “Creation’s blithe and petalled [or multifaceted] word.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en314" id="en314r">56</a></p>

    <p>As these swirls of ideas suggest, Crane’s method is one of accruement; he accumulates images rather than sorting them, allowing them to dance around the reader’s mind forming these connections. A reading of the poem begins to emerge based on these webs of associations alone, before one starts logically mapping out the lines, questioning how precisely the sea, the speaker, and the lover are related or how it makes sense for inflections to describe the quality or condition of an emotional relationship. As Thomas Yingling explains, “meaning such as it occurs in Crane, is a process of indeterminacy, is constituted precisely in the abrupt disfigurements and dislocations, in the sudden clarities and <a class="page" id="p107"></a>semantic possibilities.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en315" id="en315r">57</a> Yingling links this proliferation of meaning to what he calls “homo<i>textual</i> promiscuity,” but what I find interesting is the way these “semantic possibilities” are presented alongside images of embodied communication.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en316" id="en316r">58</a> Throughout the poem, information is expressed directly through unexpected parts of the body: the belly, the veins, the palms.</p>

    <p>Despite critiques of Crane’s logic of association as an incomplete execution of poetic vision, the poet was actually incredibly forward thinking in associating embodied language with nonlinear construction. In a letter to Yvor Winters, Crane characterizes the words of his poems as “hard little kernels,” and this description of density parallels Fox’s account of signs as “compact bundles of data.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en317" id="en317r">59</a> In the memorable final stanza of “Voyages III,” for example, the speaker describes the sea change of drowned bodies as “The silken skilled transmemberment of song.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en318" id="en318r">60</a> Like a bundle of data, transmemberment accumulates meaning through a process of stacking (and comes about as close to vertical layering as is possible in written language). Around the body circulate associations of transformation, transmission, transubstantiation (a term that Crane uses to describe his own feelings about the poem in a letter to Waldo Frank and that also recalls the idea of the “Word made Flesh”), translation, remembrance, and re-membering (a putting back together of the body that challenges the association of this process with death).<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en319" id="en319r">61</a> The body (or the body as sexual organ), the “member,” is literally subsumed in this web, in the word, merged with language and reborn as something new, the communicative act of the song.</p>

    <p>Throughout most of the poem, this alternative mode of communicating, one in which bodies appear in unexpected places, serves as a way for the speaker to attain greater understanding and to deepen the relationship with the lover. The process is halted in the penultimate section when the speaker begins to figure the sea’s language in conventional terms, breaking the spell and returning himself (and us) to more standard communication. “What words / Can strangle this deaf moonlight?” the speaker asks and is almost instantly answered when the sea’s language switches for the first time into dialogue.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en320" id="en320r">62</a> Rather than the passionate and revelatory interaction of previous sections, the language becomes banal, an imitation of sentiments exchanged by lovers throughout history: “‘There’s // Nothing like this in the world,’ you say.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en321" id="en321r">63</a> This is the first time in the poem we have communication represented with quotation marks, indicating speech, and the trite words drive a “tidal wedge” between the speaker and the sea that “no cry, no sword / Can fasten or deflect.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en322" id="en322r">64</a></p>

    <p><a class="page" id="p108"></a>There is “Nothing so flagless as this piracy,” this loss of meaningful communication, and the speaker bemoans the “Slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved / And changed.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en323" id="en323r">65</a> With the reversion to more conventional language comes the loss of intimate knowledge: “And never to quite understand!” to the speaker’s projection of verbal speech onto the sea causes it to retreat, a process the speaker wistfully narrates through direct address: “Draw in your head . . . / Your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam; / Your breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en324" id="en324r">66</a> In acknowledgment of the fall-off from the ecstatic communication of previous sections, “Voyages VI” takes on more rigid formal attributes. Much of it falls into iambic tetrameter, and it adheres to a more formal rhyme scheme than the rest of the work (<i>abab</i> in the first stanza, then variations on <i>cded</i> for the rest). The identification of subjects with verbs again becomes a bit easier as we are taken back to a slightly more straightforward narrative with the speaker venturing out onto the water, seeking in vain to recover what has been lost.</p>

    <p>As Crane demonstrates by situating it in opposition to the enforced standardization of communication, for him embodied language—with its nonlinear syntax and layered meanings—represented the future in terms of linguistic development. He perceived such nonnormative languages as having the potential to drastically change the ways human relationality was structured, specifically by creating a new level of intimacy through a merging of the semantic and the physical. In this way, he offers us insight into potential implications of manual languages, or any other nonnormative means of human expression, to fundamentally impact society by challenging our assumptions about how we all relate to one another through language.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0404">Juxtaposition</h2>

    <p class="paft">Understanding the ways in which the characteristic features of Crane’s “hard little kernels” are constituent elements of actual embodied languages expands the range of interpretive possibilities we bring to his poems. A similar interpretive expansion occurs when we interrogate the relationship between signed languages and juxtaposition. Indeed, one way of understanding juxtaposition is as an attempt to produce some of the effects of simultaneity in necessarily linear language. We see this most vividly in art that investigates the relationship between the visual and the linguistic, in both of its most prominent modernist varieties: literary cubism and imagism. One of the benefits of considering modernist <a class="page" id="p109"></a>juxtaposition in relationship to the simultaneity of signed languages is that it enables us to connect these artistic experiments—experiments that have often been critiqued for their treatment of embodied subjects—to embodied language and to locate bodies in texts where they have heretofore been largely invisible. Both sets of examples I consider in the following sections—Gertrude Stein’s <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1914) and theories of visual poetics; and William Carlos Williams’s “The Great Figure” (1921) and Charles Demuth’s 1929 <i>I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold</i>, described by the artist as a portrait of Williams—work at the intersection of words and images. As they demonstrate, it is precisely in such spaces that bodies have a habit of making unexpected appearances.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0405">Tender Bodies</h2>

    <p class="paft">Perhaps none of the famed “difficult” modernists is more closely associated with cubist literature than Gertrude Stein. A well-known patron and collector of visual art in her home in Paris, Stein’s declarations of the impact of visual arts on modernist literature have shaped the ways critics have approached this intersection, as well as her own work. To begin, I examine some of what Stein herself said about the relationship between images and words and place both these and contemporary accounts of vision in conversation with what we have learned about visual languages from ASL linguistics. I then turn to Stein’s <i>Tender Buttons</i>, a collection of textual portraits of objects, food, and rooms to argue that what this context helps reveal is the presence of bodies within the work.</p>

    <p>Focusing on Stein’s interest in the visual is far from a novel approach. Indeed, inspired by the writer’s own commentary on her work, critical discussion of the relationship between Stein’s texts and visual art has dominated the discourse. As Neil Schmitz argues, such an emphasis on Stein’s relationship to cubism can be problematic because it “reduce[s] <i>Tender Buttons</i> [as well as Stein’s other works] to the status of an exercise.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en325" id="en325r">67</a> It also threatens to crowd out alternative approaches to the text; in particular, Schmitz is keen to direct attention toward the ways that Stein’s work challenges “the primacy of <i>its</i> assumptions, <i>its</i> intelligibility, . . . its stability” through its indeterminacy.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en326" id="en326r">68</a></p>

    <p>Conscious of the danger of beating a dead horse, however, I want to return (at least briefly) to the well-trod ground of Stein and the visual arts to make the case that placing her experiments in the context of actual visual (signed) languages enables us to identify the connection between her interest in cubist art and this indeterminacy. As ASL linguistics <a class="page" id="p110"></a>suggests, indeterminacy emerges as a necessary consequence of the structure of visual languages. Drawing out such connections enables us both to recognize in Stein’s theories about the temporality of visual language ideas that can reframe our discussions of signed languages and to register the ghostly presence of bodies in her work.</p>

    <p>For Stein, artistic composition, as well as modernity itself, emerges through the process of looking. As she explains in “Composition as Explanation,” a lecture that was originally presented to the Cambridge Literary Club in 1926 as part of an effort instigated by Edith Sitwell to make Stein’s largely unpopular experimental work more saleable,</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="bqs">The only thing that is different from one time to another is what is seen and what is seen depends upon how everybody is doing everything. This makes the thing we are looking at very different and this makes what those who describe it make of it, it makes a composition, it confuses, it shows, it is, it looks, it likes it as it is, and this makes what is seen as it is seen. Nothing changes from generation to generation except the thing seen and that makes a composition.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en327" id="en327r">69</a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">Art itself—the composition—by this account emerges as a consequence of a specifically modern way of looking.</p>

    <p>The “what is seen” of modernity—at least the “what is seen” that was of interest to Stein—was specifically linked to the ideas of simultaneity that emerged both in cinema and in cubist painting. In her own writing method, which attempted to employ in written text ideas from the cinema about the collapse of series, she draws on the way a film projector takes a collection of celluloid images and plays them so quickly that they blur into one another; the eye sees only the moving picture, rather than each element in the series. As Stein explains in “Composition,” “Beginning again and again is a natural thing even when there is a series.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en328" id="en328r">70</a> This looping refuses the expected horizontal progression of a line, challenging our understanding of a “series” by stacking the images vertically. Stein’s use of repetition accomplishes a similar effect in prose. Rather than moving the sentence forward, the repeated words make it loop back on itself. In troubling the linearity of the reading process, Stein also undermines the notion that there is particular meaning at all. If the semantic content of the words changes and one cannot move from one part of the sentence to the next along a predictable path, it can never be clear which version of the meaning of a word achieves primacy. Stein <a class="page" id="p111"></a>conceived of this democratization of words in specifically political terms. In “A Transatlantic Interview,” she explains the process by which “words began to be for the first time more important than the sentence structure or the paragraph”: “I was a little obsessed by words of equal value,” a balance she likens to the “evenness of everybody having a vote.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en329" id="en329r">71</a> Cubist art similarly attempted to collapse a series—in this case, generally of spatial perspectives of a subject—in a simultaneous presentation that refused to grant primacy to any particular perspective. In Marcel Duchamp’s <i>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</i>—a painting that both thrilled and enraged audiences when presented at the 1913 armory show in New York—for example, the action of moving down the stairs is collapsed into a single moment as the nude figure is presented as a series of geometric planes that suggest both the states of the movement and all angles from which such action could be viewed.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en330" id="en330r">72</a></p>

    <p>As I have demonstrated, this kind of temporal compression is a feature that attends actual visual languages through the vertical rather than horizontal accumulation of information. Stein described the collapse of the multiple into a simultaneous moment in her own work as the enactment of “a continuous present,” an expansion of the present through a return to ideas that was not a repetition in the same way that the diverse perspectives from which we see Duchamp’s nude are not a repetition or, more precisely given the linguistic nature of Stein’s work, the way that Valli’s tear is never exactly itself.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en331" id="en331r">73</a> It was this aspect of the potential for textual images that Stein latched onto in her own portraiture. It was not mimesis, in other words, that attracted Stein, but a deeper understanding of and excitement in the potential of visual language that went beyond realist representation as traditionally understood. As Jamie Hilder puts it, “this is what cubism was for Stein: a movement in language.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en332" id="en332r">74</a> Stein was correct in her association of such movement and indeterminacy with visual languages. And in actual visual languages, juxtaposition and indeterminacy emerge as necessary byproducts of those languages’ relationship with the body. What thinking about this context helpfully reveals in Stein are the traces of such bodies, specifically, as in sign languages, the bodies of individuals frequently marginalized.</p>

    <p>On the surface, <i>Tender Buttons</i> is decidedly (and in defiance of expectations for portraiture) not about bodies at all. The book is divided into three sections—objects, food, and rooms—and is composed of a series of portraits of these inanimate things. In the book’s focus on the inanimate rather than the animate, we already have a displacement of the body from where we might expect to find it. In “A Carafe, That Is a Blind <a class="page" id="p112"></a>Glass,” the piece that opens <i>Tender Buttons</i>, for example, the conventions of portraiture would suggest that we are being given a representation of a drinking vessel:</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="bqh">A carafe, that is a blind glass.</p>

      <p class="bqs">A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en333" id="en333r">75</a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">Ulla Haselstein argues that it is the referentiality provided by the pieces’ titles that constitute the only convention of literary portraiture to which Stein adheres.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en334" id="en334r">76</a> It is precisely this referentiality, however, that “A Carafe” challenges. What is the object at the center of this portrait? Recalling Stein’s argument that there is no such thing as repetition, the doubling of the title deconstructs rather than pulls into coherence the supposed object of study. “A carafe” on its own is an object one can firmly imagine; “that is a blind glass” simultaneously undoes any clarity that might have been achieved with the first part of the title and introduces the language of vision—specifically an absence of vision—into the poem.</p>

    <p>“Blind” as an adjective most logically amends an animate subject (a blind person, a blind animal), but here that subject is only an absent presence, called to mind as the reader attempts to work through the more challenging proposition of making “blind” attach to “glass.” What does it mean for a glass to be blind? Does it suggest that the glass is partially full (that one cannot see through it)? That it does not reflect the image of the viewer? When objects are described as blind—as in a blind street—the most common, if obsolete, meaning is a dead end.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en335" id="en335r">77</a> Here, however, we run into another problem. In what sense can a glass be a dead end? Is the reference a metatextual commentary on the audience, a kind of joke in which we begin a notoriously difficult book with a “dead end,” a suggestion of the ways the following text will challenge our reading practices (which might be figured as looking through a glass to pull difficulty into focus)? If so, does this opacity where we expected clarity (in both the metaphor and reading of the poem) suggest the futility of interpretation writ large or merely that we need to adjust those practices, to find a different kind of glass to look through?</p>

    <p>Even the relationship between the two parts of the title is ambiguous. Does the “that is” of the poem’s title mean that “blind glass” is meant to clarify “carafe,” an equivalent to “in other words”? Or are they meant to be read separately: “A carafe” and the observation that “that is a blind <a class="page" id="p113"></a>glass,” perhaps made while looking at a separate object? Again, far from pointing us toward a singular subject of the portrait, the title, the thing that we might expect to be most stable about it, fractures out of our interpretive control in a proliferation of meaning reminiscent of Crane. Whereas Crane linked such indeterminacy explicitly to bodies, however, here Stein ties it more specifically to vision.</p>

    <p>This association between whatever it is that is the poem’s subject and vision continues in the first line with “spectacle”; perhaps the “spectacle” can “correct” the blindness of the glass. If so, we may not be at a dead end after all, and our own vision (our critical reading practices) can similarly be improved with adjustment. In this reading, the entire poem becomes a set of spectacles, realigning the way readers encounter words in preparation for the rest of the book.</p>

    <p>In “spectacle,” the glass that refocuses our vision, the corrective device that enables an enhanced kind of seeing, Stein also returns to the specters of bodies called to mind by “blind glass.” Such nonnormative bodies, in the context of looking and “pointing,” direct us to another of the meanings of “spectacle”: “A specially prepared or arranged display of a more or less public nature (esp. one on a large scale), forming an impressive or interesting show or entertainment for those viewing it.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en336" id="en336r">78</a> Such public demonstrations, particularly of individuals deemed to be oddities, were massively popular during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

    <p>While the practice of exhibiting nonnormative bodies was not a uniquely modern phenomenon, it was at this time that the shows began to take on a specifically scientific significance. As Rosemarie Garland Thomson notes in her introduction to <i>Freakery</i>, the specific contribution of modernity to the freak show was to move “the freak from the embodiment of wonder to the embodiment of error.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en337" id="en337r">79</a> Rather than being interpreted as fantastic oddities, such bodies were increasingly read as examples of nonnormative embodiment that modern society saw as its function to ameliorate through scientific processes suggested by the looking glasses of “A Carafe,” as well as by references to classification (“A kind in glass,” “a cousin,” “an arrangement,” “not unordered”). As I discussed in chapter 2, following on the popularity of freak shows, public demonstrations were also specifically employed by educators of deaf and blind children to make the case for the efficacy of a particular pedagogical method, and to gain public funds. This cluster of associations would explain both the association of “spectacle” and “strange” as well as the seemingly reflexive need to qualify that these spectacles are “nothing <a class="page" id="p114"></a>strange,” as a comment both on the regularity of such “entertainments” and on the ways in which they had, by this point in time, begun to be recognized as distasteful.</p>

    <p>The poem circles around vision and blindness. It is “arrange[d] in a system to pointing” us toward the marginalized bodies that never make a full appearance on the page. <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>’s secondary definition of “spectacle” similarly reminds us of the elision of such bodies through their objectification: “A person or thing exhibited to, or set before, the public gaze as an object either (a) of curiosity or contempt, or (b) of marvel and admiration.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en338" id="en338r">80</a> The ease with which subject is turned into object, and the human (blind) subject made invisible in the spectacle that is ostensibly intended to provide greater understanding (where understanding is linked to vision), introduces a challenge to the idea of interpretation in the poem that invites an attentiveness to the ways language enables this elision to occur. If the “blind” object suggests a dead end to a particular kind of reading process and a push toward something new, perhaps it is in response to this slippery danger of the meanings we usually associate with particular signifiers.</p>

    <p>In tackling vision (ways of looking), the poem challenges our ideas about bodies and about words. “Not unordered in not resembling” suggests a kind of redemption for the outlier (a version of difference as valid) at the same time that it metatextually comments on the writing itself, insisting that its failure to resemble other kinds of writing, or to present a version of portraiture that provides a more easily digestible description of the subject, does not constitute a lack of meaning. Similarly, the portrait’s sly ending—“The difference is spreading”—points toward both a politics that draws focus back to marginalized bodies and new reading practices that reveal such possibilities to us.</p>

    <p>“A Carafe, That Is a Blind Glass,” that is, opens <i>Tender Buttons</i> by juxtaposing images that we cannot link to the poem’s nominal subject (a carafe) through traditional reading practices. The refusal of this collage of images (“glass,” “cousin,” “color” “a system to pointing,” “blind glass”) to neatly cohere demands that readers wrestle with a radical level of indeterminacy, one that it explicitly links to vision and one that calls attention to bodies marginalized by traditional looking and reading practices.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en339" id="en339r">81</a> Attentiveness to the embodied elements of visual languages enables us to bring these bodies into focus.</p>

    <h2 class="ah" id="ah0406"><a class="page" id="p115"></a>Visual Texts and Textual Paintings: Charles Demuth and William Carlos Williams</h2>

    <p class="paft">A similar reemergence of suppressed bodies takes place in other kinds of word/image pairings from the period. A particularly rich example of what James E. Breslin calls the “cross-fertilization of the arts” occurs in the chain of influence that produced William Carlos Williams’s “The Great Figure” and Charles Demuth’s <i>I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold</i>.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en340" id="en340r">82</a> As with Stein, in this space where the visual meets and merges with the textual, we witness an unexpected, and potentially ethical, appearance of bodies. Charles Demuth was a painter, best known for his association with the precisionist school of art that he helped establish and popularize. Also called cubist-realist art, precisionism was a specifically American take on ideas present in cubist and futurist works, one that celebrated the industrialization of American scenes by depicting them in geometric forms.</p>

    <p>Much precisionism shared with cubism an interest in visually representing the totality of an object by collapsing space to present it from multiple perspectives simultaneously. This influence is decidedly recognizable in a series of nine portraits Demuth completed between 1924 and 1929 of his friends Georgia O’Keeffe (1924), Arthur Dove (1924), John Marin (1925), Eugene O’Neill (1927), Gertrude Stein (1928), and finally William Carlos Williams in 1929.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en341" id="en341r">83</a> Inspired by Stein’s take on portraiture, and the relationship between language and image, Demuth’s paintings did not provide representations of the likenesses of these individuals; rather, they attempt to capture traits of their subjects through line, color, words, and juxtapositions. As Edward A. Aiken puts it, “unlike traditional portraiture, they do not beguile us by physiognomic verisimilitude into thinking we <i>know</i> the subject. To the contrary, they demand that we be willing to enter the game that the artist has established if we are to identify the subject.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en342" id="en342r">84</a> As with so many other difficult modernist texts, the portraits rely on juxtaposition, as well as a combination of allusions to the subjects’ other works and personality traits in order to make sense of them. It is up to the viewer to work through these webs of allusions and determine which are significant. Similar to the Eliot epigraphs I discussed at the beginning of the chapter, this mixture of personal and public referents contributes to interpretive indeterminacy.</p>

    <p>These elements are particularly highlighted in Demuth’s portrait of the American poet William Carlos Williams, his longtime friend and the subject of his <i>I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold</i>. Continuing the theme of cross-modal <a class="page" id="p116"></a>sharing, the painting draws on imagery from Williams’s poem “The Great Figure,” first published in the poet’s 1921 collection <i>Sour Grapes</i>, as well as the artist’s sense of Williams’s oeuvre and his personality and experiences, particularly those that had influenced his creation of the poem. Williams recalls in his autobiography visiting a friend in Manhattan: “I heard a great clatter of bells and the roar of a fire engine passing the end of a street down Ninth Avenue. I turned just in time to see a golden 5 on a red background flash by. The impression was so sudden and forceful that I took a piece of paper out of my pocket and wrote a short poem about it.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en343" id="en343r">85</a></p>

    <p>“The Great Figure” emphasizes the juxtaposition of sensory impressions provided by the engine:</p>

    <div class="senseline">
      <p class="slf">Among the rain</p>

      <p class="sl">and lights</p>

      <p class="sl">I saw the figure 5</p>

      <p class="sl">on a red</p>

      <p class="sl">firetruck</p>

      <p class="sl">moving</p>

      <p class="sl">tense</p>

      <p class="sl">unheeded</p>

      <p class="sl">to gong clangs</p>

      <p class="sl">siren howls</p>

      <p class="sl">and wheels rumbling</p>

      <p class="sll">through the dark city.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en344" id="en344r">86</a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="pcon">In a reversal of the challenge that Demuth was to face translating Williams’s poem and poetic style into a visual image, in “The Great Figure,” Williams attempts to communicate this visual information linguistically. Significant for our consideration of visual languages, one way the poem does this is to realign the traditionally horizontal sentence along a vertical axis. As Breslin notes of another Williams poem, the poet’s realignment makes the poem multidirectional; it is an attempt to circumvent the necessary linearity of written language as much as possible so that the scene (and words) can be apprehended almost simultaneously.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en345" id="en345r">87</a> There is also an attempt to collapse time in the juxtaposition of past and present; the poem gives us a specific moment in time, that in which the poet “saw” the fire truck. But the movement itself extends that present, “moving,” “rumbling” forward in time.</p>

    <p>“Among” similarly seeks to resist stasis, both for the truck, passing among the raindrops and lights, and for the viewer, whose perception is <a class="page" id="p117"></a>fragmented by them. The prismatic shattering of light through raindrops suggests the kind of perspectival multiplicity that Stein provided via syntactic bending and repetition. Also paralleling Stein, the poem gestures toward elided bodies not mentioned in the poet’s fascination with the appearance of the truck itself. We are left with a tension between the speaker’s specific (embodied) visual perception (“I saw”) and the multiple perspectives implied by the poem’s opening suggestion of a (multifaceted) prism. The “tense” truck stands in for the bodies written out of the poem, those who the truck is going to help, who have logical reason to be tense in ways neither the enthralled speaker nor the unheeding crowds do. The fascination with the mechanical, with the truck, invites a displacement of human qualities away from ignored bodies and onto the inanimate; they are elided and dehumanized in exact proportion to the move to personify the object.<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en346" id="en346r">88</a> On the surface, “The Great Figure” celebrates precisely that speed of “movement,” of “wheels rumbling” through the city, the powerfully bright flashes of red and gold. But it also reveals the process of making invisible marginalized bodies that too often accompanies this kind of aestheticization.</p>

    <p>Demuth’s painting similarly explores the position of the subject in relation to modernist juxtaposition, fragmentation, and difficulty. The painting literalizes the fragmentation of perspective suggested by the absent present prism that opens the poem: the rays of light, darkness, and rain diagonally bisecting the canvas and shattering our perception of the engine, which, as in a cubist work, we see from multiple angles simultaneously. The canvas is dominated by the poem’s reds and golds, lights and darks, as we perceive the engine coming at us, the repeated number fives moving closer and closer, the lights on the front growing larger and larger, the diagonally bisecting lines of rain and light suggesting the engine’s hood at the same time that the horizontal thrust of the red rectangles present a view from the side. The combination of the frenetic movement of the light lines, the fives hurtling forward in space, and the headlights that seem simultaneously in front of and behind the train produce a sense of depth. The gray, black, and white rays of rain and shadow that move across the entire piece are arranged at the bottom of the canvas to parallel the grill lines of the front of the engine, further contributing to the feeling that it is simultaneously behind and in front of the viewer.</p>

    <p><i>I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold</i> offers a visual representation of the kind of layering of perceptions that Williams aims for with the vertical orientation of his poem. Together this layering and orientation function to <a class="page" id="p119"></a>create a sense of action that exists in tension with the horizontal thrust of the red rectangles and, more specifically, the two-dimensional text of the piece. The references to “Bill,” “Carlos,” and “W.C.W.” direct viewers toward the portrait’s subject in he same apparently transparent manner as the title of a Stein portrait. As in Stein’s work, the idea that this is a portrait <i>of</i> Williams is deeply complicated by everything else in the piece, particularly the use of the same color and font (which appears like a printer’s typeface) for the initials “W.C.W.” and Demuth’s own signature, “C.D.,” both of which appear at the very bottom of the canvas, suggesting that Williams in some way exists inside and outside the painting, as both its subject and cocreator.</p>

Behind them is a rectangular shape that evokes the outline of a train viewed from the side. In the upper half of the image are four circles that resemble headlights. Diagonal lines crisscross the canvas. Those at the bottom of the painting suggest both the shape of the grills found at the front of steam engines and refracted light.

    <p>As Breslin points out, the painting’s text functions as one of the more compelling examples of the piece’s contradictory pull. It is primarily these two-dimensional textual signifiers that remind us of the work’s subject (the poet and the poem), as well as the fraught relationships between movement and stasis and between two and three dimensions, which are at its heart. “It is important,” Breslin notes, “to see how many features of the painting offer contradictory clues, like the multiple possibilities in a poem by Williams. . . . The point . . . is not to select a ‘correct’ reading, but to suspend alternate possibilities simultaneously.”<a class="enref" href="../Text/Sanchez-0013.xhtml#en347" id="en347r">89</a> Significantly, it is the text in the painting—the intersection of images and words that point to the unmentioned, unimaged bodies of painter and poet, as well as those absent present bodies in the poem that inspired the work—that enable us to recognize this range of interpretive possibilities and suggest the necessity of holding all in suspension rather than selecting one.</p>

    <p>Having developed a painting style through a careful consideration of the ways his peers had attempted to produce the effects of visual simultaneity within written works, Demuth then uses the written word within a visual work of art to signal back to that simultaneity, positing it as a necessary consequence of the collision of images and language. Over the course of this chapter, I have analyzed how such unexpected insights repeatedly emerge from texts that appear superficially to have very different stakes and interests. Whether by revealing the connection between indeterminacy and simultaneity in engagements with bodies, as in the work of Valli and Crane, or by enabling us to recognize the presence of bodies in works that do not foreground them, as in Eliot, Stein, Williams, and Demuth, Deaf epistemology highlights unexpected ways that the body aligns with aspects of modernist difficulty—indeterminacy and juxtaposition—that have tended to be read as either decidedly un- (and <a class="page" id="p120"></a>even anti-) corporeal or that have reductively made use of disabled bodies as a metaphor for brokenness. In the next chapter, I continue to explore more productive implications of the intersection of images, bodies, and texts by returning to the question of temporality and its relationship to space in modernist conceptions of the image.</p>
