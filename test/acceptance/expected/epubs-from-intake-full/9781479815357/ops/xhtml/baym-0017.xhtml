      <p class="pf">In a <i>Guardian</i> profile,<a id="en344r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en344">1</a> Bruce Springsteen described meeting fans at book signings, estimating he’d signed seventeen thousand copies of his autobiography. He assured the reporter he’d enjoyed it: “You meet the fans—but you meet them one by one. And they have an opportunity: what’s the one thing you always wanted to say over the 40 years of the relationship we’ve had? I actually found it quite moving. Always enjoyed that part. I used to love to drift around, bump into people, see what their lives were like, wander into their lives for a few moments then drift back out. It appealed to the transient nature of my personality. I liked the idea of being here and then being gone, this little spirit moving through the world.”</p>
      <p>Springsteen describes his relationship with his audience as moving and long-standing, but also transient and ephemeral. He is a “spirit,” wandering into their lives, then drifting away. Recordings fostered deeply significant emotional attachments, yet always at a distance. To really connect, musicians in the past needed platforms like concerts, fan letters, and brief, often-ritualized, in-person encounters. Norwegian star Sivert Høyem describes himself as “one of the last analog musicians,” having started his career at a time when you’d only meet your audience “after the gig or before the gig or in the t-shirt lines or record signing.”</p>
      <p>Today it’s hard to even list all the sites where artists meet their audiences. They still come together at concerts and many other forms of in-person encounters. But musicians also meet audiences on fan sites, their own websites, their blogs. They maintain profiles on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace (less now), Tumblr, Instagram, YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Indaba, Snapchat, Line, Twitch, you name it.<a id="en345r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en345">2</a> Some have apps or use bots that interact with fans through instant messaging platforms on their behalf. As the communication ecosystem has grown, new media generally complement concerts, book and record signings, and other modes of direct encounter rather than replace them. Each platform offers options and poses challenges.</p>
      <p><a id="p140" class="page"></a>“Affordances” are qualities of an object or interface that people perceive as creating possibilities for action, just as a button seems to invite pushing.<a id="en346r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en346">3</a> Whether built of code or wood, platforms make persuasive rhetorical arguments about the kinds of interactions that should take place upon them.<a id="en347r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en347">4</a> Far from neutral, relational affordances, such as those I describe in this chapter, shape interactions, relationships, and the work of maintaining connections. As Arlie Russell Hochschild writes of organizational institutions, the settings in which we interact “guide the way we see and what we are likely to feel spontaneously.”<a id="en348r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en348">5</a> Settings shape what Erving Goffman calls the “participation frameworks” of everyday conversation, or the continuously shifting roles people take toward one another and the things they say in their interactions.<a id="en349r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en349">6</a> This chapter compares the three settings for audience encounters that artists mentioned most in our interviews. I compare two settings in the concert hall, the stage and the merchandise table, to online platforms to show how each social setting, online and off, provides relational affordances that influence who is there, who has power relative to whom, and how ritualized their interactions are.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lena reminds us that “it is extremely important to analyze the spaces in which music is experienced because spatial arrangements impact the form and nature of community engagement.”<a id="en350r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en350">7</a> Among the arrangements she mentions are “the size of the venue, the amount of distance and interaction between musicians and audience members, and the volume of the music.”<a id="en351r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en351">8</a> Christopher Small’s classic <i>Musicking</i> shows how orchestral halls afford particular kinds of relational dynamics among those present, offering them a chance to announce their identities to themselves, one another, and anyone else who may observe. To attend, people must buy tickets, affirming “the separation of those who produce from those who consume and the impersonal relationship of a society whose dominant mode of relating is through the passing of money.” Small argues that the concert hall raises questions that “concern relations of power” among those present, asking, “Who decides what is played and how it is played? Where does the authority of the person in charge come from? Who cedes it to him or her? Such questions involve not only the performers but also the audience and may extend beyond the walls of the concert hall.”<a id="en352r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en352">9</a></p>
      <p><a id="p141" class="page"></a>Ultimately, Small argues, the concert hall “dramatizes and makes visible certain types of relationships,” bringing some people together and keeping others apart, giving some dominance while positioning others as subordinate, and facilitating “communication in one direction but not in the other.”<a id="en353r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en353">10</a> To drive home his point, Small invites us to “imagine a performance in which the members of the orchestra sold the tickets themselves, arranged their own seating and moved the piano around and where everyone, audience as well as conductor, soloist and orchestra members, stayed afterward to clean up.” The result would not necessarily be a better set of relationships, he argues, but it would reflect and support a social order that saw people as equals and encouraged them to know one another as individuals.<a id="en354r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en354">11</a></p>
      <p>We don’t normally think of settings like concert halls as platforms in the same way we think of a site like Facebook as a platform, even if stages are the original, literal “platform.”<a id="en355r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en355">12</a> Yet the concert hall, with its inner settings like the stage and the merchandise table, are every bit as influential in shaping the relationships between artists and their audiences as are online platforms. In comparison to the stage and the merchandise table, social media afford a new norm of everyday closeness, removing historic barriers between musicians and audiences, while offering little ritualized guidance for how to behave. While once musicians could show up at a concert hall, where audiences would come to them, social media encourage artists to go to the audiences, seeking them where they already are, doing what they are already doing, and engaging them in ongoing interactions. The relational dynamic shifts as audiences gain equal access to the floor, more topics are raised, and power becomes more evenly spread.</p>
      <p>To say that platforms shape interactions and relationships is not to say that they determine them. There are many other influences. People perceive and make sense of affordances, and make choices about how to use platforms based on those perceptions.<a id="en356r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en356">13</a> For one musician, a platform like Facebook may feel natural and easy. For another, the uniformity of its template may feel anonymizing and mechanistic. Groups develop idiosyncratic and social norms about how to use platforms, from the symphonic audiences who expect assigned seating and silence when musicians are on stage<a id="en357r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en357">14</a> to the indie audience members who <a id="p142" class="page"></a>cluster densely, actively, noisily, even violently, in front of the stage.<a id="en358r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en358">15</a> Individual social media platforms develop their own emergent norms. Facebook may be a “nice” place, at least for male musicians, while YouTube comments are famously mean, and Twitter is known for enabling harassment. The norms of the world outside also shape what happens on any given platform. Platforms arise from and are permeated by existing social dynamics, but as people work out new norms for behavior within the limits they afford, they create new social dynamics that can extend beyond their boundaries. The widely used affordance of posting mobile phone photos on social media, for instance, has reshaped concerts into photography events at which audience members may seem as focused on their phones as on the stage.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0501" class="ah">Concert Halls</h2>
      <p class="paft">Before recording technologies, all music was “live.” Now liveness, once taken for granted, carries meaning of its own. “The live,” Philip Auslander writes, “was brought into being by the possibility of technological reproduction.”<a id="en359r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en359">16</a> As music took technological forms that freed it from temporal and spatial limits, the time- and place-bound embodiment of “live” encounters became more ritualized and special.<a id="en360r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en360">17</a> “As people don’t buy records as much as they used to,” the Swedish independent label entrepreneur and musician Johan Angergård told me, “gigs seem to grow more important as a way of connecting to the bands in a bit more physical way. Only listening to mp3s on your computer without ever having seen the band, the artwork, read the lyrics, seen the pictures might be a bit to un-personal for many.”</p>
      <p>Concert events create bases and boundaries for relationships between artists and audiences before anyone shows up for the event. Audiences gain access through buying tickets, which, as Small describes it, frames the relationship as that between a producer and customers. Furthermore, at least some, and probably most, of the people who buy tickets are fans, or at least people willing to give musicians the benefit of the doubt for an evening. This too positions audience members as different from the performer, while positioning them as similar to one another. Time is important too. Concerts put temporal boundaries around the relationships they create. They are events in which musicians and audiences spend a <a id="p143" class="page"></a>few hours together, perhaps less, then part. Fans may follow bands on tour, and musicians and audience members may also be friends, but from the event’s point of view, once the lights come up there is no further relational obligation, no promise of continuity. Concerts are designed to foster a powerful ephemeral sense of connection, not a foundation for ongoing person-to-person relationships between musicians and those in attendance. Within a venue, different spaces afford different relational possibilities. Two of these, the stage and the merchandise table, are central to musicians’ relationships with their audiences and illustrate well how different platforms give rise to different relational possibilities.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0501" class="bh">The Stage</h3>
      <p class="paft">Stages, and the seating or standing room before them, tightly constrain the roles and behaviors available to those in attendance. Stages are built for “presentational” performances,<a id="en361r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en361">18</a> which cast performers as elites before a larger group of people in the collective role of audience. Before a show, in most concert venues, musicians are kept backstage and out of sight, taking advantage of an architectural affordance that not only offers little social contact between them and their audiences but, like the hall as a whole, “seems, in fact[,] designed expressly to keep them apart.”<a id="en362r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en362">19</a> “We don’t really meet people face-to-face anymore,” Mogwai’s Stuart Braithwaite said, “because the places we play all have dressing rooms behind the stage so we don’t really get out among the people.”</p>
      <p>Once on stage, the architecture and other infrastructures and technologies of the event put musicians in charge of audiences who observe. “There is no bigger difference than being in the audience and looking up at the stage and being on the stage looking at the audience,” a musician told Wendy Fonarow.<a id="en363r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en363">20</a> Only the musicians pick what comes next. Only they have the elevation, amplification, lighting, and infrastructural support to speak loudly and command all the attention. The space is designed so audiences face the stage, most explicitly when there are rows of seating affixed to the floor, but even when there is open space for standing or dancing. At larger shows the audience and stage are separated not just by architecture but by security personnel—what Brian Travers of UB40 described as “an electrified fence with crocodiles in front of the stage.”</p>
      <p><a id="p144" class="page"></a>Musicians hold the floor—indeed they are obligated to do so—while audiences cede it. To earn this right, musicians are expected to perform in their “musical personas” lest they seem self-indulgent.<a id="en364r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en364">21</a> Performers are, after all, at work, while the audience is at play, further instantiating the division between them.<a id="en365r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en365">22</a> The musicians’ job is to make music. They may engage in some between-song banter, although they can also get away with none, as Bob Dylan famously does, or with lines clichéd enough to rival athlete interviews: HELLO BOSTON! ARE YOU READY TO ROCK? HOW YOU ALL DOING TONIGHT? THIS ONE’S FOR THE LADIES! Though their communicative repertoires are limited, they’re limited in ways that put the focus on the modes of communication they’ve chosen, including, most of all, music.</p>
      <p>Those on stage often experience it as a seat of power, whether they think they are deserving or not. The Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards explained the way his audiences react to them on stage as evidence that humans need demigods. “In lieu of finding out what that greater power is,” he told Jenny Boyd, “people set up their own earthly version of it in order to express it. I stand on the stage and I’m thinking, what are you looking at me for? A damn old junkie hacking away at the guitar, what is this? This must be a primal need.”<a id="en366r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en366">23</a> Frank Foster, who led Count Basie’s Orchestra, described himself as “hypnotizing” the audience from the stage, looking at someone in the center of the auditorium. “I can’t see their face clearly, but I look directly at them while I’m playing, and I am actually hypnotizing that person,” he told Boyd, “I’m aware of some kind of movement, something is vibrating when I look directly at someone, and I imagine this to be some kind of power coming from or through me. It’s concentrated on that one point where that individual is then it vibrates; it spreads from that one point, and it’s somewhat the same as a pebble being dropped in a lake. It expands outwards. It expands through the auditorium and spreads to everyone out there.”<a id="en367r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en367">24</a> Peter Frampton likewise told Boyd, “It starts to become a sort of emotional feedback. I become totally uninhibited onstage. People in the audience are reacting to my actions and my mood as well as the music. I know that I can control the feeling in the audience.”<a id="en368r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en368">25</a></p>
      <p>The stage’s affordance of focusing attention on the musicians fosters a power differential, but can also prompt a transcendent sense of togetherness. “I always felt connected to the audience,” the Cure’s Roger <a id="p145" class="page"></a>O’Donnell swore; “it doesn’t really matter to me if there’s fifty people or fifty thousand.” The experience of connection between “performers and listeners may be close, intimate, and even loving [as] the back-and-forth passing of energy from performers to listeners and back again can carry the musicking to a tremendous pitch of excitement that can approach and even cross the threshold of possession.”<a id="en369r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en369">26</a> One of my favorite concert moments came at a Feelies show, a band whose concerts consistently bring me bliss. This night, during a lull between songs, a fan near me took advantage of the quiet to yell “You make people happy!” The band grinned as the crowd all laughed with self-recognition. We were focused, together, and we were, indeed, happy.</p>
      <p>Audiences willingly cede the floor, in return for which they get not only the music, but also “the right to examine the speaker directly, with an openness that might be offensive in conversation.”<a id="en370r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en370">27</a> Sexualized gaze, sometimes demanded, sometimes unwanted, is often a given. “Sexual/romantic appeal and fantasy are one of the great draws for music audiences,” writes Turino. “While it is often considered impolite to stare at attractive members of the opposite sex, there is special license to do so when they are on stage.”<a id="en371r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en371">28</a> Turino doesn’t say it, but there is even more license to stare at members of your own sex when they are on stage. Writes Fonarow:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">The gig is one of the few Western spectacles in which female (rather than male) spectatorship is fetishized—overvalued and expressed. . . . By locating sexual desire in the female spectator, the rock performance inverts the traditional Western object of erotica from the female to the male. Here both men and women gaze upon men, and men are recognized to be the libidinal objects. Bono, the lead singer of the band U2, once said: “Being a rock ‘n’ roll star is like having a sex change. People treat you like a girl—they stare at you and follow you down the street.”<a id="en372r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en372">29</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">The concert is one event where both men and women can freely examine others’ bodies.</p>
      <p>Yet, even as the stage empowers musicians, its affordance of immediate visual and auditory audience feedback undermines the artists’ dominance. The very frame of “performance” means that audiences have the right to evaluate how well you do.<a id="en373r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en373">30</a> There is a reason most of the few <a id="p146" class="page"></a>scholarly articles I could find about musicians’ interaction with audiences focused on overcoming stage fright. The lights may be bright and performers may “use a variety of gaze strategies during performances to suggest that they do not see audience members,”<a id="en374r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en374">31</a> but generally musicians are keenly aware of individuals in the crowd. As one told Fonarow, “I could tell you everything you did during the show and you’d never know I was paying attention.”<a id="en375r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en375">32</a> An audience’s feedback is crucial to musicians’ experience and to the relationships people construct during a show. “We’re not in a band to make records,” Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy told Greg Kot. “We’re in a band because we like to play together, and feel good about doing it, and have people respond to that in a way that is immediate and unfiltered.”<a id="en376r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en376">33</a> Audiences may respond with adoration. Like Beatles fans, they may “sob uncontrollably while screaming ‘I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die.’”<a id="en377r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en377">34</a> More likely, if they like you, they smile or clap, dance or sway. Some may hold signs. But audiences can also be antagonistic and disrespectful, challenging the authority inscribed by the setting. While some musicians feel empowered on stage, others interpret the dynamic differently, seeing power as located in audiences.</p>
      <p>Live performances are sites where musicians can resolve the “anxieties about the significance and effect of their work,” as discussed in the first chapter.<a id="en378r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en378">35</a> But live audiences can also stoke those anxieties, sometimes simultaneously. “The feeling I get when I’m playing to an audience,” Buddy Guy told Boyd, “is ‘Am I reaching you?’ ‘Am I getting to those people through communication with my music?’ And I look out and I see a smile. Something tells me then, you’ve got it. But there are also days I don’t get that smile. My message is not getting to you, so I’ve got to go back and figure how to get my message to you through my music—and that’s what keeps me going with my music.”<a id="en379r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en379">36</a></p>
      <p>The tension is exacerbated when you don’t fit the mold audiences expect in your genre. David Grazian described the frustration white blues musicians felt performing before white audiences who aggressively “threaten their authenticity and self-respect.”<a id="en380r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en380">37</a> Honeychild Coleman is a black woman whose bands play the predominantly white, male genres of punk and shoegaze. She’s played festivals “where people were angry or annoyed or condescending because they didn’t like the instrumentation of my band. They thought I was gonna get up here and go <i>shoo-bee-doobie-doo-woo-woo-woo</i>, and do an R&#x26;B song even though I’m wearing a <a id="p147" class="page"></a>RAF t-shirt and a leather skirt. But then nobody left. I was like, ‘Yeah, they were holding their ears, but you notice nobody left.’ So that’s how I knew they were listening, and it just made me smile as soon as I saw it.”</p>

      <p>Despite the limited behavioral repertoires available to them while musicians are playing, like the happy Feelies fan, audiences have many ways of validating artists during a show. They yell between songs, they smile, they dance, they sing along, they stay. O’Donnell has his eye on the crowd and listens to them intently no matter how big the arena. “Whenever they’re singing along, that’s good,” he told me, “and you can tell if there’s a couple and you play their special song and they turn to <a id="p148" class="page"></a>each other, those kind of things are nice. It’s that sort of feedback from the audience that I think is really rewarding.”</p>
      <figure id="fig0502" class="figure">

        <p class="figh"><a data-locator="p148" class="page"></a><span class="fighn">Figure 5.2.</span> Roger O’Donnell (right) of the Cure, in concert in Boise, Idaho, 2016. © Ken Wilcox, and made available under a<span class="fighn"> CC BY-ND 2.0</span> license. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenwilcox/27860225320.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>Audiences also engage in behaviors that challenge musicians’ right to the floor, upsetting what they understand to be the tacit relational agreements guiding these encounters. O’Donnell complained of being distracted and annoyed when people move from their ticketed seats to new ones, particularly when security has to intervene. People who talk while they’re playing bother him as well. “Save some money and save everyone a lot of pain, because it’s just very disrespectful.” Many venues derive most of their income from alcohol sales. This affords drunkenness, which can foster audience antagonism. For a time, people up front used to aim laser pointers at David Lowery’s bands while he played. He began carrying his own so he could stop the performance on the spot and point back. In larger venues, audiences may throw bottles, something Casey Rain, whose Desi band, Swami, has been “bottled,” described as “pretty funny but at the same time kind of upsetting.”</p>
      <p>For some, especially women, drunk audiences can be frightening. Kristin Hersh described the disappointment of finding that audiences for her noisy band 50FootWave attracted “this kind of frat boy element” <a id="p149" class="page"></a>that “get[s] really drunk.” They “don’t know the difference between smart music and loud music and those guys can be difficult for me. And so my [male] bass player now scouts out exits as soon as we get on stage so that I don’t have to go through the crowd if there’s a thuggy element. . . . It’s just hard for me to deal with people like that. I should take karate or something.”</p>
      <p>Which audience members engage in which behaviors is influenced by the layout of most unseated venues. As Wendy Fonarow insightfully describes in her ethnography of British indie audiences, in unseated venues audiences self-organize into three zones.<a id="en381r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en381">38</a> Zone 1 is closest to the stage. These spots cost more, either in money or sweat equity and possible physical harm. The people there are demonstrating their interest by being where they are and are the audience segment most likely to be most enthusiastically engaged with the show. Fans who have seen multiple shows are probably up front, so there may be familiar faces for those on stage to look out upon. Increasingly, though, Zone 1 is filled not with enthusiastic faces, but with phones. Just as it can send messages of disengagement when among friends, looking at screens instead of stages can alienate performers. “Now photographers at shows click and then look at the screen and they miss everything that happens on the stage,” Lowery’s Camper Van Beethoven bandmate Jonathan Segal sighs; “that’s completely weird addictive behavior.” As we saw in the last chapter, in addition to the problems posed by the presence of the phones themselves, the fact that everyone in the crowd can then post their photos and videos online invites nonpresent participants into the occasion, often without musicians’ consent and sometimes against their express wishes.</p>
      <p>In Zone 2, around the borders of Zone 1, are people who are older, have seen more shows, or are just less interested. Their response is physically muted, although they may be contemplating the performance deeply. While people in Zone 1 are generally enthusiasts, it can be harder for musicians to assess where they stand relative to those in Zone 2. I was at a sold-out show in a club that holds a thousand people where there is both a main floor and a balcony level wrapping around the side walls and back of the venue. The crowd up front swelled with people close together dancing, clapping, and singing along. I stood in the side balcony so I wouldn’t have to look at the middle of someone’s back and <a data-locator="p150" class="page"></a>would be free from pushing and jostling. That was not how the band’s young frontman interpreted it. “I’m going to need more from you,” he pleaded. “Even you important people up there,” he said, gesturing toward our part of the venue, “You’re intimidating. You’re so nonchalant that you’re at a concert.”</p>
      <figure id="fig0503" class="figure">
        <p class="fig"><img src="../images/F_05_03_BAYM.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></p>

      <p>It took Brian Travers twenty years of touring not to see what this frontman did. “There can be twenty thousand, thirty thousand people going crazy and dancing, and I’d see the one guy or the one girl who’s doing this” he told me, crossing his arms. “And that’s the only person I could see. And I would be looking at them all night, thinking ‘oh what have we done wrong’ and pointing the saxophone at them and trying to talk to them.” Travers’ epiphany came when he was in the audience at a Smiths show. He was listening intently to Johnny Marr’s guitar playing when he looked down at his own body and realized he was that one guy. “I don’t think I’ve jumped up and down at a gig since I was about seventeen or eighteen. I always stand there and go ‘Wow, listen to him. <a id="p151" class="page"></a>Listen to her, isn’t she good.’ So even with all that experience, you know, we must have done, two thousand, three thousand gigs in twenty years. Even then, I didn’t see it.”</p>
      <p>People who lose interest often wander to the back of the venue to Zone 3. This zone is filled with music professionals who don’t have to pay to get in and are keen to distinguish themselves from those in Zones 1 and 2. These audience members don’t need the affordance of the concert to build a relationship with the musicians, either because they don’t care, or because they have “privileged access to the ultimate status markers, the performers themselves,” before or after the concert.<a id="en382r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en382">39</a></p>
      <p>The relational power balance that stages seem to afford are thus not as simple as their architecture suggests. Within inflexible roles and tightly constrained behavioral repertoires, audiences have many ways to challenge musicians’ apparent supremacy. Travers cautions his peers against misunderstanding the encounter:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">You’re there for them. They’re not there for you. You’re there for them. This gets confused, I think, and people lose the essence of what their gig’s about. And the music suffers as a result, and the performance suffers. You’ve got to listen to the audience, and listening to them is looking at them in the eye, looking square at them. Music is the communication between the musician and a member of the audience and, more importantly, the member of the audience and the musician. What comes back, not just what you’re putting out. It’s what they’re happy for you to play. That’s another kind of complicated part of the relationship. It’s not just giving them what they want. It’s them letting you give them what they want. They give you permission to be what you’re going to be onstage, because they don’t have to clap. They don’t have to clap. The audience gives you permission to be what you are onstage. You might think you’re in control. That’s not the case at all. You walk onstage and hopefully communicate with them, touch down with them and surrender basically, and then put them in charge. Because they are in charge, not you. And if you forget, the second you forget that, they can tell you’re not listening to them. And you think the audience is there to listen to you. No. You’re onstage to listen to them and to play to them, and that’s the job.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p152" class="page"></a>Like Travers, musicians may reject the relational power dynamic the concert setting seems to afford through interpretation. Others may go so far as to avoid stages entirely. Electronic Dance Music performances, which (at least until recently) “relentlessly” seek moments of shared collective experience, often place DJs on the floor amid the dancers.<a id="en383r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en383">40</a> “I love music with people up front,” the DJ Deepchild told me, “but I like the music that I do because it does feel more like people are dancing for each other rather than the person up front.” Steve Lawson, the ambient solo bass player, plays primarily small house concerts, which “feels far more productive to me as a human being than me standing on a stage with a bunch of lights shining around playing to a bunch of people I can’t even see who are all kind of varying degrees of enjoying it or worrying about something.”</p>
      <p>Musicians may also reject or play with the stage’s implicit relational dynamics through media. Electronica artist Richie Hawtin delights in designing new technologies to disrupt the stage’s power balance. For one tour he and his friends developed an iPhone app called Synk. During the concert, the app allowed him to instantaneously unlock the phones of everyone there who had it installed. Surprised audience members started seeing words moving around on their mobile screens. As they touched those words, moving them around and zooming in and out, they gradually realized their actions were affecting the sound around them. “At that moment,” Hawtin said triumphantly, “I stop being the performer, they’re performing.”</p>
      <h3 id="bh0502" class="bh">The Merchandise Table</h3>
      <p class="paft">In small venues, immediately after a performance, artists often go to a table, usually toward the front of the venue, where exiting audiences will pass. An array of merchandise like CDs, t-shirts, posters, and stickers is displayed on top of the tables and often on a wall behind. People traveling with the artists or working for the venue sit behind the tables to manage sales while audiences line up to buy. From the stage, Jill Sobule pressures audiences to stop by and spend some money with humor. “I always end my last song with, ‘I’ll be out in the lobby selling my ware’ and ‘I have four children with no healthcare,’ you know, I just make up something. It’s always been that way. I always feel like a traveling <a id="p153" class="page"></a>salesman.” Musicians like Sobule often stand behind or near the table to sign what audiences have bought and, sometimes with annoyance and sometimes with pleasure, pose for fan selfies.</p>
      <p>The merchandise table offers very different relational affordances than the stage. It is the one institutionalized platform in the concert hall where the separation of artists and audience is breached.<a id="en384r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en384">41</a> Where the concert was about one-way communication from the stage outward, the merchandise table is about one-to-one interaction. The audience is no longer one large group with a few standout faces or irritants, but a series of individuals like those at Springsteen’s book signings, each with as much access to the floor as the musician and the chance to finally tell them in person what they’ve always wanted to say. When audience members wait in line and interact personally, they become stand-ins for the crowd as a whole, translating “the feelings of excitement and connection that the audience has during the performance back to the performers.”<a id="en385r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en385">42</a></p>
      <p>Interactions at the table, like those during the concert, are often highly ritualized (“Will you sign this?” “Sure, what’s your name?” “Nancy.” “Here you go”). Fans often touch the performer, more so than they would have before a show, which Fonarow takes as a sign that musicians have accomplished “the illusion of the effacement of barriers between audience and performer” during the concert.<a id="en386r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en386">43</a> Musicians sign autographs, pose for pictures, hug fans, listen to their stories. For British folk-punk singer Billy Bragg, these conversations can last longer than the shows. “It can get a bit crazy sometimes. But you get a look in their eyes, you get to feel up close and personal, what it means to them, how they feel about me and my music. I wouldn’t miss it for the world. That’s the most important bit to me, of all the communication I have with people who like my music. It’s that after-show connection.”</p>
      <p>I ask him if the after-show connection is more important than the performance itself. “On stage it’s a different thing,” he responds, “you’re in control and you’re taking them with you. You’re looking out for them and you’re picking up on them.” He continued:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">But once you’re down from the stage, you’re on their level and look them in the eye in that small individual connection. Then you’re in their control. When you’re on stage, they’re in your control. You’re in charge. <a id="p154" class="page"></a>You’re setting the agenda and you’re deciding what is going to happen next. When you’re the one doing the t-shirts, each one of them decides what’s going to happen next. You don’t know what’s going to happen next, you’re responding to them, rather than them responding to you; it’s a reversal. And that’s when I start to pick stuff up and learn stuff and find stuff out and make mental notes. That’s quite important.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Standing on the same floor both literally and conversationally, with no special lighting or amplification, musicians are brought down to their audiences’ size.</p>
      <p>Jon Ginoli, of the celebratory gay punk band Pansy Division (and the formative college radio show of my adolescence discussed in chapter 3), also appreciated this leveling, for reasons both activist and carnal. “Our music has always been about trying to break down boundaries and break down barriers so I wanted to do that personally as well,” he told me. “I want to hear other peoples’ stories. Especially people who were much younger than me who, were it not for my band, I really wouldn’t have much contact with. So to be able to see what the next generation is going through, what their issues and crises are. And also, and I have to say this, it would be sometimes fun to meet people who I might sleep with.”</p>
      <p>These same affordances that Bragg and Ginoli appreciate—being on the same level, looking one another in the eye, touching, and telling personal stories—are hard for musicians who feel most comfortable communicating through music. Some may not feel the closeness their show has instilled in some members of their audience. They may not want to be touched. They may not yearn to hear stories, particularly when they become repetitive. “It’s always like ‘oh, what were you thinking when you did this?’” said one drummer, “or ‘my cousin’s boyfriend’s stepmom’s roommate’s lover saw you guys here and you give a stick to him, don’t you remember that?’ And it’s like ‘no.’” Musicians may not feel like fending off sexual advances. “This sounds so stupid coming from the school of kind of punk rock that I grew up with,” fun’s touring bassist Nate Harold confesses, “but it gets annoying and overwhelming. I’m tired of taking pictures with people I don’t know and having people make weird comments to you and signing shirts and stuff like that. Sometimes girls can be a little forward. That aspect of music has never appealed to me and it always weirds me out. That’s usually when I make my exit.”</p>
      <p><a id="p155" class="page"></a>Musicians may even feel trapped. Lloyd Cole is content with applause. “Knowing that the concert was extremely enjoyable for the people, does validate things for me,” he says. But he knows that he will make more money if he goes out and interacts with his fans at the merchandise table. “Frankly, it’s economics, and I try to be as courteous as I can in selling my CDs.” He misses the early days of his career when you could</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">maybe, if you were lucky, meet somebody in the street and get them to autograph a piece of paper when they were leaving a concert. But there was no way you could be standing next to somebody after a concert with them signing your CD and engaging them in conversation. Especially when you’re drunk, which—that’s the thing when I go out and sign CDs afterwards. Every now and again I get cornered by a drunk fan, and what can I do? I’m standing there and I’m just sort of nodding my head going, “Okay. This is how I make a living.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Being cornered by drunks is not the worst of it. In 2016, singer Christina Grimmie was murdered at the merchandise table at her gig in Orlando, Florida. “I get threats constantly—all female musicians do,” the musician Grimes told the<i> Fader</i>. “People want to, like, rape and kill you. It’s, like, part of the job. One time I was backstage at a show, and there was this random guy in my dressing room, and he just grabbed me and started making out with me, and I was like, Ah!, and pushed him off. Then he went, ‘Ha! I kiss-raped you’ and left. Shit like that happens quasi-frequently. When I play a show I have to have, like, three bodyguards in front of the stage, and then I have to have bodyguards on the side.”<a id="en387r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en387">44</a> Hersh’s suggestion that she learn a martial art is not hyperbole. The affordance of co-presence can be validating, but they can also be alienating, scary, and even lethal.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0502" class="ah">Social Media</h2>
      <p class="paft">Like concert halls, social media sites are built environments, designed to foster some social practices and discourage others. Unlike brick and mortar institutions, they are constantly changing, as are the devices through which we access them. At the time I spoke with them, the musicians I interviewed used a variety of sites, but there were three <a id="p156" class="page"></a>that everyone either used or felt compelled to account for not using: MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Today that list would likely include Instagram and Snapchat. By the time you read this, there will probably be others. MySpace, launched in 2002 with tight ties to the Los Angeles music scene, embedded music players in everyone’s profiles, let musicians and fans “friend,” post messages to profiles, and direct message one another. The impact for bands with established audiences was huge. “When MySpace became popular and people could write straight to a band,” reflected Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">I think that was a point—I think a lot of people had never considered that you could just email a band. So when that first started we got a lot of correspondence through MySpace from people I don’t think would have considered sending us an email. I mean I remember one guy, an American soldier guy in Iraq, sending an email about how he’d listen to our music to kind of try and you know escape from his dreadful day to day existence. And I can’t see that guy having written us an email. So yeah that was definitely sort of a bump thing.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">MySpace was like the merchandise table writ large, but without the merchandise. The site had fallen from favor by the time I started interviewing, but its influence on social networking sites and expectations of how professionals might use them cannot be understated. Facebook and Twitter were the platforms all the artists I spoke with thought of as most important.</p>
      <p>The three sites share many features—there are profile pages for individuals and/or bands. Their network structure makes ongoing and visible links between musicians and individual audience members possible. They all label connections and responses, though they do so differently. Each platform offers multiple modes of interacting. All allow people to post updates, which are aggregated into personalized feeds for each user. All allow some form of one-to-one communication as well as both public and private interaction. All offer validated “official” accounts for musicians, although that does not always work as it should. All provide some visible metrics of popularity—how many “friends,” how many “followers,” how many “fans.” However, in a crucial difference, MySpace’s embedded music player let artists communicate primarily through their <a id="p157" class="page"></a>music if they chose. Facebook and Twitter, in contrast, encourage artists to interact through words, images, and videos, but make it hard to foreground the centrality of sound in their relationships with audiences.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0503" class="bh">Unbinding Participation</h3>
      <p class="paft">Concert halls limit and constrain the norms and forms of communication, as well as the relational dynamics among those there. Social media unbind them, opening an array of relational possibilities while imposing constraints of their own. Many social platforms explicitly label the connections they enable. On Twitter, “followers” “follow” artists who can choose whether or not to follow back. Relationships can be asymmetrical. Musicians may follow potential fans as a way to draw their attention. The power is in each person’s hands to make a relationship symmetrical or not. On Facebook, “fans” “like” musicians’ pages. The relationships afforded by fan pages are even more asymmetrical than Twitter’s, since artists have no mechanism for following fans back. When people’s privacy settings are locked down, they can’t even learn much about who the fans are by looking at their profiles.</p>
      <p>Facebook does let musicians be “friends” with fans if the connection is managed through a personal profile. This can cause complications. Jill Sobule, for example, would prefer that all her fans be “friends” on Facebook, but the company made a design decision that people can only sustain five thousand friendships and put a cap there. Having surpassed the limit, every couple of weeks Sobule turns on the TV, logs on, and rejects friend requests, apologizing as she asks people to be fans instead. This means that for every person she meets in any capacity and would like to be friends with on the site, she would need to “unfriend” someone whose connection she valued less. Another musician accepted friend requests from fans before Facebook created fan pages. Now he’d like to move those people out of his personal feed and over to his official page, but he can’t envision a polite way to do it.</p>
      <p>Concert halls create boundaries for relationships in part by limiting entry to those willing to pay, thus creating a commodified focus as well as a social foundation of audience commonality and musician superiority. In contrast, musicians’ social media profiles are generally public, making them accessible to anyone who uses the platform. This doesn’t <a id="p158" class="page"></a>mean the relationships are unencumbered by capitalism. Having a social media presence is often seen as a means of monetizing audiences. Furthermore, much as venues monetized the artist-audience relationship by selling alcohol, social media platforms monetize the relationship by selling ads.</p>
      <p>Unlike the concert hall, though, with very few exceptions, social media platforms do not provide audiences with direct ways to transfer money to artists. You can talk to a band directly on Facebook or Twitter, but try paying them there. With exceptions such as YouTube and Twitch, most sites that offer a monetization option link to other platforms or, more often, ignore whether musicians can make money through the site. Even tip jars are rare. From the platform’s perspective, so long as musicians and audiences are there, it really doesn’t matter. The way audiences pay on social media, if they pay at all, is with attention and the currencies of likes, favorites, retweets, and other visible displays of popularity, all of which accrue to both the artists and the platform, but none of which pay rent or cover recording costs. The money in social media flows between sites’ owners, investors, and advertisers, not musicians and audiences. The business models of all social media sites rely on “manipulating and monetizing social data,” something for which “people making connections and constructing communities is a necessary pretext.”<a id="en388r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en388">45</a></p>
      <p>Audiences on social media include some of the people who show up at concerts, but also many others. A social media account may reach fans, friends, family, peers, other music professionals, people who don’t know the artist or like the music but like the tweets, as well as people who hate the music or artist and take pleasure in being mean to them online. These platforms thus complicate the notion that musicians have a singular audience and raises questions about what counts as an “audience” in the first place. On social media, musicians have “to negotiate a complicated social environment where fans, famous people, and intermediaries such as gossip columnists co-exist. These multiple audiences complicate self-presentation, since people present identity differently based on context.”<a id="en389r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en389">46</a> Think of Zoë Keating, an instrumental, new-classical solo cellist with more than a million followers on Twitter. She has nowhere near as many listeners, let alone people who would pay for a <a id="p159" class="page"></a>ticket to see her play or purchase her music. She’s “certainly under no illusions” they are all fans. She also knows that the people who follow her on each platform are different from one another. And it’s not clear how any of them map on to who exactly buys her album or shows up to see her live, although some of them certainly do. How is she to know what a million plus people who don’t even listen to her music expect from her as a tweeter? Which self is she to put forth?</p>
      <p>Audiences may also be missing on social media sites. Høyem is one of Norway’s most popular musicians. Yet when we spoke, he had fewer than a thousand Twitter followers. As I write, it is up to nearly twelve thousand, still far fewer than either his Facebook following or his actual fan base. A simple explanation is that not many Norwegians use Twitter. With one out of every seven people on earth now using Facebook on any given day, listeners are more likely to be found there. As Steve Lawson pointed out, “there are a whole lot of people who treat the entire internet like Facebook. And they very rarely go outside of it.” Yet some fans may not even use Facebook, and those who do may never click “like.”</p>
      <p>Goffman describes conversationalists as sorting one another into different categories of listeners through their microactions, creating “participation frameworks” that orient participants toward one another and toward what is being said.<a id="en390r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en390">47</a> Some listeners—like those at a live concert or facing you at the merchandise table, are “ratified,” meant to hear the message. “Addressed” recipients are ratified listeners who have the right, and may be expected, to respond. Bystanders, like venue staff and other people waiting in the merchandise line, are ratified. Speakers know they are there, but it is socially inappropriate for them to reply to what’s said. On social media, anyone following an account is ratified, although specific recipients can be addressed by name, making the others into bystanders. Nonratified recipients—those who listen while pretending they don’t—are what Goffman calls eavesdroppers. People who watch and listen to unauthorized concert recordings and livestreams or look at photos posted online might be considered eavesdroppers on those events. Social media eavesdroppers include people who read without logging in or following and, crucially, automated bots that mine public content for reuse elsewhere. Just as they complicate the general definitions and distinctions of “audience,” social media make it extremely hard <a id="p160" class="page"></a>to know on a moment-to-moment basis who exactly is standing by, who is eavesdropping, and whether the people you are addressing are even going to see your message.</p>
      <p>On a site like Facebook, which filters people’s feeds algorithmically, messages musicians post for those who have liked their page may never appear in those people’s feeds. The algorithms are currently weighted toward “friends” and against “pages,” putting musicians at a structural disadvantage in reaching their fans. “Organic reach” is very low. Inorganic reach, the kind you pay for, can be better.<a id="en391r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en391">48</a> Messages posted to social media can also be replicated and spread to audiences other than followers. This is great for publicity purposes, but also means that even as intended recipients may not hear you, unratified audiences may. It can be easy to forget these other audiences. Roger O’Donnell, for example, described “the trouble with Twitter” as “being at the pub, and a subject comes up, and you’re standing there with three or four mates, and you’re just like, ‘oh, blah, blah, blah.’ And then you realize there’s hundreds of people reading it, and also it comes up in Google.” Musicians, like most of us, simply can’t imagine all their potential readers every time they post, let alone craft messages that serve them all equally well.<a id="en392r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en392">49</a></p>
      <p>Musicians also take advantage of the presence of eavesdroppers and bystanders. Twitter and Facebook are, as van Dijck argues, ideal for advertising the self. Metrics such as follower counts signal your popularity, and hence your revenue potential, to professionals making decisions about whom to sign to a label or book in a venue.<a id="en393r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en393">50</a> Using simple metrics like follower counts or retweets to make this kind of judgment is naïve, as I’ve discussed elsewhere.<a id="en394r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en394">51</a> Platform algorithms tend to amplify attention rather than distribute it evenly, simultaneously noticing and creating trends. “Friending, liking, following, trending and favoriting are all subject to their respective site’s engineering mechanisms of filtering, selecting, and promoting certain users and content over others,” writes van Dijck.<a id="en395r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en395">52</a> Metrics can also be bought. What exactly they measure is ambiguous at best. Nonetheless, their existence and visibility affords social hierarchies based on whose numbers are higher. On Twitter, for instance, “the ability to attract and command attention becomes a status symbol.”<a id="en396r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en396">53</a> It doesn’t happen to Beyoncé, but normal musicians may have followers with more followers than they have. Fans who might appear to <a id="p161" class="page"></a>be one of the crowd in an auditorium may thus come across as influential and powerful on social media.</p>
      <p>Even as social media blur boundaries between audiences and calls into question whether there is really “an” audience at all, like the merchandise table, the voice they afford audience members can make fans more individualized and real for musicians. Social media sites may feel to some like they reduce people to avatars and cookie-cutter profiles with privacy settings musicians cannot penetrate, but they can also foster the possibility of getting to see, and even know, audience members. This can change artists’ perceptions of and relationships with their live audiences. Coleman described her surprise at looking through her Facebook fans and discovering that despite her own perceptions, she didn’t already know them all. Ska musician Chris Murray uses his Facebook page to connect names to the faces he sees repeatedly in Zone 1, relying on the site’s insistence on a real-names policy, and its emergent norm of using pictures of one’s self for avatars. “I have a page on Facebook where there are over 4,000 people,” he told me: “I’ll see somebody at a show a few times. I’ll start to recognize, ‘Oh, here’s somebody who’s coming to shows, becoming a regular,’ and then I see their face on Facebook with their name and that really helps me out because it’s like, ‘Oh, there’s that person. Oh, this is their name.’ I forgot it the three times I met them in person, but, if they start liking stuff that I’m posting and I see their name and face repeatedly, that helps me out. So, definitely, it strengthens my connection.”</p>
      <p>If social media blur the participant frameworks that sort listeners into different types of audiences, they also obfuscates what Goffman calls the “production formats” that make clear who is speaking on behalf of whom.<a id="en397r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en397">54</a> Unlike the concert venue, artists can make choices about whether they need to be the ones “authoring” and “animating” their own messages while still appearing to be present and engaged. If you have ever seen a famous person walking down the street or eating in a restaurant somewhere, you know that in face-to-face situations they cannot escape their public personas. On social media, the person who appears to be the musician online may be their manager, an intern in the management office, someone else entirely, or even a bot trained to speak on their behalf. Unless messages are written in third person (as they often <a id="p162" class="page"></a>are) or signed with something like “Team Greta” (as Emily White’s staff does when posting on behalf of Greta Morgan), it can be hard for audiences to know.</p>
      <p>Artists with resources often do have staff who handle all or some of their social media. “Having people help update concert dates or things like that that don’t have a huge amount of personality in them is very helpful,” says D. A. Wallach. But when it comes to messages with personality, he, like many others, insists it come from him. “I just feel pretty strongly about writing those myself, because if you’re going to send an email out to fifty thousand people, it’s pretty important that it’s exactly on message and in the right voice.” A manager I know told me how much he enjoys responding as one of his artists. In his view, fans were thrilled to get a response they thought came straight from the musician, the musician was thrilled someone else dealt with it, and he got the thrill of being able to make people happy so easily with just one tweet. Other managers, and some artists, think that’s unethical. In an in-between position are stars like Beyoncé, Usher, Taylor Swift, and Mariah Carey who, even as they work with digital strategists, have at least a role in approving all the messages that go out as their own.<a id="en398r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en398">55</a> This can provide a good strategy for finding the middle ground between closeness and distance on which the next chapter will focus.</p>
      <p>People unaffiliated with the artists also pretend to be them or, often in acts of fandom but sometimes with nefarious intent, appropriate their names. Social media companies’ verification process, which uses blue checkmarks to affirm that accounts really do belong to the person whose name is on it, only go partway toward mitigating this problem. Cowboy Junkies were unable to claim the @cowboyjunkies Twitter handle, for example, having to settle for the verified but nonintuitive @CJmusic. Their Twitter bio reads “The OFFICIAL Cowboy Junkies Twitter feed. Someone took our name.” Høyem was never able to get verified on MySpace since a major record label that did not represent him claimed his name first. When it first began verifying accounts, Facebook went through a sweep of musician pages in which they judged many real accounts to be fake and replaced what musicians and their audiences had built together with imported versions of artists’ Wikipedia pages. (Amusingly, but indicative of the challenges, when I tried to claim the Facebook page that had been created from importing the Wikipedia page about me, <a id="p163" class="page"></a>Facebook replied vaguely and without recourse that I did “not meet the criteria” to claim the Nancy Baym page.) Audiences may also do their own verification. Having been in public places like city streets and restaurants with Michael Stipe and seeing how impossible it was for him to escape his persona, it was more than a little entertaining to see “stipey” grilled when he first appeared in online groups where R.E.M. was being discussed in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Social media architectures thus afford musicians choices about which participation frameworks to invoke. They can treat listeners in different ways, using social media like a stage, broadcasting to all without having to listen to what their audiences post or respond. Musicians can also share the floor with audience members, using social media to interact one-on-one and in group discussions. Ceding the floor or hiding their presence entirely, eavesdropping or bystanding, are also choices. This flexible participant structure offers musicians what Stephen Mason described as “a more controlled conversation” than real-time face-to-face encounters. At the same time, just as having to address too many audiences at once can be overwhelming, since everyone else has equal access to the floor, for those who pay attention, the incoming flow of messages can quickly become overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Social media lessen the limits imposed on participation by concert halls, creating more malleability in who can address and listen to whom, and granting audiences as much access to the floor as musicians. Social media also lessen the temporal and spatial participatory limits afforded by platforms like those in the concert hall. Log on any time, wherever you are. There will be messages from and chances for artists and audiences to interact. Social media thus encourage relationships grounded in the everyday and the all day. Audiences go to concerts for a ritualized special event. On social media, artists go to the audiences, “sneaking into their daily routine,” as Morgan described it. The relationships social media afford are not about one intense encounter but the open-ended accumulations of message exchanges over time that come to feel like relationship. The opportunity to speak to the audience directly, wherever they may be, whenever you like, is a powerful way to sidestep the gatekeepers of both concert venues and the media. But it also poses challenges. When you can post any time at all, how little is too little? How often is too often? No sooner had one musician gotten into “a rhythm of <a id="p164" class="page"></a>just constantly putting a little mark in the sand,” posting daily to Facebook, than others began telling him “you’re just always in my stream, you have to cut down.” How is one to judge? And what is one to do when the expectations themselves are constantly evolving?</p>
      <p>This question of how often to post is further complicated by site architectures. Frequent posting may let you hit enough feeds to get the likes, comments, and shares that can teach filtering algorithms that your messages are interesting. Sindre Solem, of Norwegian metal band Nekromantheon, described the importance of continuous posting: “It’s important to stay active, show that you’re alive, and every time I post something like that, you can see that you’re getting more likes every time, because it reaches out to more and more people, because people who didn’t like you before can see if their friends have pressed Like, or commented on what you posted. So it’s a slow but safe way of building your reputation and showing that you’re still alive. And perhaps it gets people to check out your music.” On Twitter, the messages are so short and frequent, the feed so fast moving, that most users who follow hundreds of people never scroll down far enough to catch every message. Posting often can help mitigate that as well, but the problems of who is talking, who is listening, and whether and how the algorithms help or hurt persist. Some musicians, such as Maroon 5, have begun using bots that work through Facebook Messenger as a means of communicating directly with fans in ways that neither algorithms nor rapidly scrolling timelines can impede. “It’s among the most intimate ways that you can connect,” Ben Parr of Octane AI, the company that makes bots for Maroon 5 and other celebrities, told me: “there’s no algorithm between you and your audience.”</p>
      <h3 id="bh0504" class="bh">Unbounding Behaviors</h3>
      <p class="paft">The ways people act at concerts and the merchandise table, and often other fleeting encounters, are highly ritualized. Social media platforms have norms, but neither artist nor audience behaviors are so tightly bound. By opening participation, social media also afford a much wider range of behaviors. MySpace put music front and center, and encouraged artists to present themselves in their musical personas. In this sense, it shared qualities with the stage that Facebook and Twitter do <a id="p165" class="page"></a>not. Many musicians still regret the loss of MySpace as a viable venue for showcasing their music (though they do not miss the spam, the porn, or the constant requests from other musicians to help them book gigs). This desire to communicate through sound has helped fuel the rise of the music-sharing platform SoundCloud. Twitter and Facebook privilege verbal and visual exchange over musical exchange. Musicians can communicate in words, pictures, links, retweets, and likes, but there is no standardized official way to communicate in song.</p>
      <p>The less a platform is designed to play music, the more questions musicians have to answer about how they should communicate through it. On stage, artists play music and banter between songs. At the merchandise table, when time together is brief, they can take their prompts from their interlocutors. But what do you put in an empty update rectangle that sits before you, ever ready to be filled? Musicians are pushed by design toward covering a wider range of topics than they would in the concert hall. “There’s more give and take now,” Timmins explained. You still send out your music, but you also talk about songs, about touring, about much more than music. “So I guess there’s more chances of reaching people on different levels, not just musically. And so people are reacting not just to songs now but also to what you’ve written.”</p>
      <p>The pressure on musicians to produce continuous content so as to be a present and available relational partner can be overwhelming in its demands and underwhelming in its results. Høyem shakes his head. “There’s just so much information now, it’s just this manic stream of just trivial information that all these celebrities and artists are just spewing out. Most of it is just bullshit, and I don’t want to be part of it. It’s just information for the sake of information. There was just this feeling that there had to be continuity, there had to be a stream of information, there had to be updates every day, and that was the whole point, and not what I wrote.”</p>
      <p>Audience behavior, no longer constrained by limits on who can be present and engaging, or by access to the floor, is likewise unbound. Fans continue the practices described in chapter 3, but they, and others who are not fans, also talk to musicians much more often and in many more ways than before. For musicians, this loosening of conventions about how and when audiences can communicate with them can be both more validating and more unpleasant than the interactions afforded by time, space, and behaviorally constrained settings.</p>
      <p><a id="p166" class="page"></a>The everyday nature of social media interaction means that fans can offer musicians much more mundane affirmation at the moments musicians most need it. Artists often spend time alone, whether between gigs or while writing and recording. During these times, the chance to hop instantly into a ready-made setting where fans are waiting to offer encouragement means that audiences can offer the sort of ongoing, casual social support that we expect of friendship. “When you do music it’s hard to get any—I guess any real positive feedback,” said one musician. “It’s like you do a record and no one hears it and you slave over it. It’s really hard to do. You do that for six to nine months. And then people start hearing it. And playing live shows really ties all of that together. But also it’s good to see what people are actually thinking about it [on the internet].”</p>
      <p>White, manager of the reunited Urge Overkill, described their songwriter’s reaction to seeing audience response online: “Eddie would say, ‘Yeah, you know, I’ll be at home writing songs and does anybody care?’ And then he’s like, ‘But then I post on Twitter and Facebook and all these people respond immediately. And I’m like, wow, people really care.’” Høyem would agree. “I like knowing that there’s a lot of people out there who are interested and seeing what their reactions are whenever I’m posting information about a new gig or a new tour or new music.”</p>
      <p>But just as audiences can invalidate during concerts, whether by talking to one another, switching seats, throwing things, or booing, audiences are critical online too. Now people have easier ways to deliver criticism straight to the source. Artists may also eavesdrop on audience criticism by reading what is posted about them. Fans may note flaws from a place of love,<a id="en399r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en399">56</a> but it can still hurt. “I don’t know if anybody likes to hear criticism,” Keating reflects. “I like the song but I think it would be better if you had done this and then they list all of the ways that the song could be better.” Some develop “thick skin” and take it in stride. “There’s always one or two people that aren’t happy with whatever it is that’s happened or what you’re doing,” Kelly told me. Some musicians take the long view and laugh. “We’ve got kind of the best and the worst fans wrapped up in one,” said one. “Whenever we put out a new record, they all hate the new record. It goes on forever. And everybody just hates it, and then they start liking it. Then after a while, everybody likes it. We <a id="p167" class="page"></a>can tell it just is very schematic. Just kind of a mechanism [laughs]. But it’s fun. It’s all in good spirit.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, not all who criticize are fans. As Bragg said, the affordances of social media are “a double-edged sword. How can you use that resource to communicate to people? And how can you allow the openness to not undermine the thing you’re trying to do? Because if you do stick your head above the parapet, people are going to have a go. If you allow people to put you on a pedestal, you can’t complain when pigeons shit on your head.”</p>
      <p>Criticism of the music is one thing, but the unbound participation that social media afford leads to far more criticism of the musicians themselves. Sometimes this comes from fans who prefer some band members to others. O’Donnell experiences this with the Cure. “There’ll be people that decide they don’t like you, as well as people that decide they like certain members of groups. There are camps that don’t like certain members, and then it doesn’t matter what you do. They’ll just talk shit about you, and they’ll find the worst. And it can be something, really nothing, and that’s all you ever hear about on forums and websites forevermore.”</p>
      <p>Other times they are not fans at all. There are, as the singer-songwriter Sydney Wayser said, “a lot of angry people online,” happy to blur the boundaries between you and your music, or between you as a person and you as a persona. These antagonists might be what Jonathan Gray calls anti-fans, people actively invested in disliking an artist, or they may simply be voicing their opinion without restraint about something they’ve stumbled upon.<a id="en400r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en400">57</a> YouTube can be particularly difficult, as O’Donnell described: “They can be mean though. It can be really hurtful, I think, especially on YouTube. I think there’s something about YouTube. The people that comment on there, I think, if you put them together and gave them weapons and put them in uniform, they could take over the world, because they are the nastiest people I’ve ever come across. It’s just venomous and evil and nasty, no holds barred. And you know if you met them in a bar, they wouldn’t say boo to you.”</p>
      <p>Some, like Sobule, avoid eavesdropping outside of their own sites. “I did for a while and then I stopped doing that,” she said, “because you’ll get a hundred really great things and then you’ll get one like <a id="p168" class="page"></a>kind of mean thing or you look at YouTube and people are just—people just comment just so they can, you know. They’re usually probably like fourteen-year-old kids or damaged ex-frat boys, I don’t know, who have nothing better to do but to say negative things. But why put myself through that?”</p>
      <p>Finally, we have seen that on occasion people in concert halls are genuinely abusive. They point laser pointers, throw bottles, and on rare occasion stalk, assault, and kill. The bounded nature of the concert hall, both as a physical space and as a limited-time event, can increase the lethal potential of these encounters. “Sometimes I’ll get the equivalent of a fan letter from someone who seems particularly confused or needy,” says Hersh. “I feel for them, but they can’t hurt me from there. The only ones that concern me are when they’re really drunk and it’s the middle of the night and I’m alone.” Online, people may feel physically safer, but the potential for audiences to send abuse never ends, whether it’s the kind of off-kilter neediness Hersh describes (and to which I return in the next chapter) or what Bragg called “unsolicited invective.” Anti-fans and drive-by insulters have as much access to you as the diehards. Bragg gets emails to “tell you that you’re shits and that you should shut up and what an asshole you are.” Lawson told me, “I’ve had people on forums going ‘you’re such a dick, I hate what you do.’ The idea that I am my music and my music is me in that way is really odd. People who come looking for a particular thing don’t find it and try to hold me responsible because they don’t like it, and I find that really weird. The internet lets them say it in a way they wouldn’t otherwise.”</p>
      <p>People often attribute such cruelty to online anonymity, but it is also common where people post under real names. Lauren Mayberry, frontwoman of the band CHVRCHES has been outspoken about the misogynistic abuse she receives. She wrote a 2013 column in the<i> Guardian</i> in which she explains that she reads “every message—good and bad—that has come into our inbox” on Facebook. Sometimes it’s affirming. Other times it’s not. “Maybe the men—and I’m sorry, but they are all men—sending the notifications of impending unsolicited ‘anal’ bothering don’t realise it will actually be me who reads the emails—or maybe they don’t care either way,” she wrote. “But in order to get to the messages from people who genuinely wish to share something with the band, I must filter through every condescending and offensive message we receive.” She <a id="p169" class="page"></a>describes scrolling through audience messages on her phone, throughout the day, every day. “After a while, despite the positive messages in the majority, the aggressive, intrusive nature of the other kind becomes overwhelming.” It makes her cry. But “after all the sniffling had ceased,” she asks herself, “why should I cry about this? Why should I feel violated, uncomfortable and demeaned? Why should we all keep quiet?”</p>
      <p>Alice Marwick interviewed tech workers in San Francisco who, like many musicians, felt compelled to use social media to have viable careers. Some of them likewise “confessed that negative comments or email flames from audience members had upset them or even made them cry. Even people who claimed that negative comments didn’t affect them had developed coping mechanisms,” including tagging negative comments and turning to friends to read incoming messages for them.<a id="en401r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en401">58</a> The internet is full of people ready to insult anyone for laughs.<a id="en402r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en402">59</a> And if you’re a woman, let alone a woman of color, they’re going to go low.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0503" class="ah">Finding New Relational Boundaries</h2>
      <p class="paft">In the last chapter, we saw how musicians manage the boundaries around how audiences participate with their work. This chapter showed how, by fostering connectivity and ongoing engagement, social media have undone the separation between musician and fan that earlier incarnations of the music business instituted, changing the ways audiences participate not just with their work, but with them. Social media’s relational affordances perpetuate dynamics that are found in the concert hall, but they also offer new possibilities of continuous, more equal engagement. Social media offer spatial, temporal, participatory, and behavioral flexibility that the prior settings for musician-audience encounters did not. While concerts fostered highly ritualized, emotionally intense, temporally brief interactions, social media are built to create never-ending interactions that generate an everyday sense of connection. Audiences have as much power as the musicians, perhaps more, as musicians vie for attention with all the other items in audience feeds.</p>
      <p>Without participatory limits over who can interact with whom and when or rituals for guiding behaviors, musicians can’t count on social media platforms to maintain relational boundaries. Whatever relational boundaries they want, whether close or distant, they must create themselves,<a id="p170" class="page"></a> platform by platform and turn by turn. With so much interactivity, they have to manage their accessibility in new ways. With social media aggressively affording daily interaction, musicians have to decide how much of their everyday personal selves they are willing to offer relative to their musical personas. The grounds of “authenticity,” so often in music tied to genre, look, and race, shift in ways the next chapter will explore. Without rituals for what to say when, there is more uncertainty about how to act. With sites constantly launching, dying, revising their terms of service, reweighting their algorithms, and redesigning their interfaces, there is more work. Musicians face all kinds of choices and questions on social media they didn’t have to struggle with in contexts that afforded more distant relationships with audiences. How much should they post? What should it be about? Should they reply to tweets or Facebook comments? All of them? This one? That one? To whom do they want to talk? To whom must they talk? Which people should they follow back or let be “friends” rather than “followers”? Control may feel like a blessing to many, but for others the need to make so many choices can itself feel unmanageable. In the final chapter, I turn to how musicians manage the ramifications of social media’s call to closeness.</p>
