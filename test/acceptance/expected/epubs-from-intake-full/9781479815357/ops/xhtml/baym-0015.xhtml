      <p class="pf">Throwing Muses were college radio darlings in the 1980s. They had recording contracts with the prestigious British label 4AD and Sire, a Warner Brothers subsidiary, in the United States. But by the end of the decade their leader, Kristin Hersh, knew her relationship with the industry wasn’t sustainable. Warner Brothers viewed her as a mantelpiece artist, using her credibility with other artists to sign bands they expected to sell better and were willing to actually promote. She didn’t want to be part of a machine she saw as pushing bad music for the lowest common denominator. Money was getting tight. But her real problem was that the industry was messing with her “religion.” Once they’d signed with Warner Brothers,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">it was someone else’s job to find fans. It was someone else’s job to advertise for shows to get people there. It was someone else’s job to deal with radio and press. We spent many years not having any idea who we were playing music for. You go out on stage and you can’t see anything but lights and then you’re allowed to hide in the dressing room and then on the tour bus. We found record signings incredibly moving because we would finally meet these people who were effectively the point. They were also what made it possible for us to practice our religion. And then we’d be hustled away and have no more contact with them.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Billy O’Connell, Throwing Muses’ manager, decided there must be a way to reconnect. In 1991, he found it. America Online (AOL) was still a dial-up service not yet linked to the rest of the internet, and there Throwing Muses fans had created a discussion “folder” called ThrowingMusic. They’d built their own connections through Hersh’s work.</p>
      <p>O’Connell jumped right in. “I was there every day, I put in a lot of time answering questions so people got answers straight from the horse’s mouth.”</p>
      <p><a id="p106" class="page"></a>“Hey it’s Billy O,” he told them. “I’m the Muses’ manager and I’d be happy to answer any questions.”</p>
      <p>The fans were delighted. They ended up “having a total love fest. I developed all these relationships. I got to know hundreds of them.”</p>
      <p>A few years later, when Hersh’s first solo album came out, O’Connell realized that if something were to happen to AOL, or if they were to change their terms of service or even their design, they could lose those connections once again. He decided to persuade the fans to move to a domain the band owned. Trusting that he understood and appreciated the subculture they had established, the fans agreed. Launched in 1994, eight years before MySpace, and even earlier than BowieNet, ThrowingMusic.com, named after the fans’ already-existing community, anticipated the rise of social networks that would follow. You entered the site through “The Place.” O’Connell explains: “It was a destination page where a fan could create a profile, own their own page, post their own posts, receive email, friend other pages. The Place got to be very popular. We started to build strong community, with the intention of owning these relationships, not having them live outside our realm, our influence, our property. So we pushed along that way getting to know people, literally hundreds.”</p>
      <p>Not long after, when Hersh and Warner Brothers finally parted ways, she and O’Connell took the entrepreneurial leap. ThrowingMusic was already built. The fans were already there. Everything was in place to sell CDs and vinyl directly to the audience. They formed their own label.</p>
      <p>It didn’t work. Direct sales weren’t enough to cover studio time. Throwing Muses broke up. Hersh continued on her own. Again O’Connell, who had fallen in love with mp3s, thought there had to be opportunity in emerging technology. “There’s gotta be a way to have fun and make money with mp3s. We have all these relationships, people so bonded and close.” The thought kept him up nights.</p>
      <p>In a moment of epiphany, lying in the dark desert, he finally devised a strategy. “Works in Progress” would be a page on the website with new exclusive content posted monthly. To access it, fans would have to subscribe.</p>
      <p>“I said to the fans at ThrowingMusic, ‘we’re doing this thing, we’re going to offer you mp3s of bedroom demos, unreleased songs, demos, outtakes, things like that, are you interested?’”</p>
      <p><a id="p107" class="page"></a>The fans said “yes!”</p>
      <p>O’Connell asked, “is $15 fair? At end of year you’d have a CD, 12 tracks.”</p>
      <p>They said “yeah!’”</p>
      <p>After some more negotiations, Works in Progress premiered in 1998. Each month they posted a new song with the story behind it, revealing aspects of Hersh and her work that she hadn’t shared before.</p>
      <p>The specifics of the business model have changed over the years, as have the exact subscribers at any given moment, but the “Strange Angels” (or “Strangels”) as Hersh calls them, have funded her career ever since. As of this writing, she offers tiered subscriptions ranging from thirty dollars a quarter for guaranteed spots on guest lists and exclusive downloads, to five thousand dollars for studio visits and executive producer status. She has subscribers from twelve countries on five continents, subscribing at each level she offers.<a id="en308r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en308">1</a> Subscription revenues cover her recording costs, allowing Throwing Muses to record again. “Every time I want to go to work I have to have enough money and they’ve made that possible. There was a huge question mark just hovering in front of musicians’ faces for so long, ‘Will I be able to make the next record?’ And the answer is usually, ‘Eh, probably not.’ And now I know that I can make the next record.” “Essentially,” she summarizes, “the point is that we do this together and the recording industry got in the way. So now we’re doing it together again.”</p>
      <p>In the last chapter we saw how, once marginalized from music production by the industrialized music industry with which Hersh struggled, passionate audiences got busy connecting to one another. They built fan communities, first through off-line clubs, then through an ever-wider array of interconnected online sites. These fan communities are consumerist, and their purchasing provides both revenues that keep musicians going and affective investments that give some of the things musicians have to offer, like autographs or handwritten lyric sheets, their value. At the same time, the norms that organize fans’ behavior toward one another operate largely outside of commerce, privileging identity, relationship, internal hierarchy, fan productivity, fan creativity, and the free trading and sharing of resources. The dialectic nature of fans as communities and markets poses challenges for artists who depend on them for income. To the extent audiences are markets, it makes sense <a id="p108" class="page"></a>for musicians to approach them from positions of power with an eye toward control, asking how they can influence and manage audiences to maximize their revenue. To the extent audiences are communities, it’s not clear how to cede power and take a more participatory stance when you are the center around whom their participation revolves. This chapter identifies strategies of relational labor that musicians use to find balances that work for them and, sometimes, their audiences.</p>
      <p>Hersh and O’Connell’s approach to the ThrowingMusic fan community is a remarkable example of creatively balancing competing tensions to foster her music’s potential to build her own and her audiences’ relationships, values, and meanings. Hersh and O’Connell accept that they work in a business. O’Connell teaches music industry courses at Loyola University in New Orleans. He uses the phrase “monetizing passion,” hating the way it sounds, but finding it articulates their philosophy of seeing “profit as a byproduct, not the point of doing the right things—providing value, a great experience, fun.” “When you sell toothpaste,” Hersh writes, “you should be selling a goo that helps prevent cavities. And when you sell music you should be selling sound that enriches the listener’s inner life.”<a id="en309r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en309">2</a></p>
      <p>Happy Tom, who described his band Turbonegro’s fan club as a Frankenstein’s monster they created but cannot control, warns against treating audiences as markets rather than communities:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">When you approach it as I’m the star and I’m going to sell you my product, you’re really selling yourself short in terms of what kinds of engagement you can have and what kind of value too. If you treat it like marketing, people perceive that you’re trying to sell them something. I think a lot of artists got trapped because it’s all about my new single, my new product. And then they think, “oh, this is a neat community.” But, I mean, do you want to be part of a community which is all about sales? I think a lot of people kind of mix that up. They think we need a community. It’s a big buzzword. Well, treat it like a community. Treat it like something you’re part of, not a sales channel. It’s not a TV shop. . . . I think that’s something we should cherish like a little baby bird.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Sometimes being part of that community means being in a position of power at the center of attention. When Happy Tom is at Turbonegro <a data-locator="p109" class="page"></a>fans’ worldwide conventions, people want to get photographs with him. He’s “kind of in an ivory tower” on “the pedestal” of the stage. He enjoys it. But the fans don’t idolize him for long. “The fans just piss on the tower. So after a while, I just go down and have a beer. We just hang out like everybody else.” For him, it’s “the best of both worlds.”</p>

      <p>The philosopher Martin Buber argues that people need both the participatory experience of approaching one another with an I-You <a id="p110" class="page"></a>stance, open to whatever emerges in the space between them, and the I-It stance, which sees others as objects we can use to better control our own paths.<a id="en310r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en310">3</a> Both ends are ideals. In practice, we move between them, juxtaposing wondrous moments of participatory engagement and flow with more calculating approaches that to help us to step back, make sense, and decide how to act. Musicians, rarely, if ever, balance the dialectic between participation and control by choosing one extreme or the other. Music is too inherently participatory and connective to make feasible a full commitment to control. For those seeking to earn money from audiences, it is bad business to focus only on participation. Love may be converted into the revenue to fund a career. Hersh did it. But it takes strategic control to make it work.</p>
      <p>In practice, strategies of control and participation are interwoven in complex ways. Artists often cede some control within a framework that they control, or they seek to impose control in frameworks where they feel disempowered. There are three dominant controlling strategies right now: territorializing to locate fans’ participatory practices on sites musicians own and can monetize, invoking the law to protect intellectual property against participatory practices, and datafying audiences and their communal practices in order to act strategically on knowledge gleaned from analytics. These strategies require resources and skills that are not available to less entrepreneurial, less networked, and less well-supported musicians. When artists orient toward participation, they use one or both of two main strategies. They may decenter themselves, stepping back to accept—and in the case of intellectual property, grant—autonomy. They may also collaborate with audience members, positioning them not as passive consumers but as active co-participants in a shared enterprise. Musicians pick and choose from both controlling and participatory strategies in different combinations and with different weights, as they try to set the boundaries of participation in their relationships with audiences.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0401" class="ah">Strategies of Control</h2>
      <h3 id="bhaft0401" class="bhaft">Territorialize</h3>
      <p class="paft">When musicians territorialize, they seek to control the sites where audiences engage in their fan practices and possibly the practices themselves. <a id="p111" class="page"></a>Official websites and, to a lesser extent, mailing lists are the primary means of territorializing. Marillion may have learned early that the internet could be used for fan funding, but they were slow to realize the importance of territory. Like many bands, they had to acquire the domain name marillion.com from a fan who had already registered it and created a fan board. Throwing Muses, exemplars of participation that they are, also engage in controlling practices. They territorialized their fans by pitching ThrowingMusic.com as a chance to enhance and preserve their practices in a place that would be protected. They took the fans’ very name, ThrowingMusic, as their own.</p>
      <p>Hersh’s manager spoke of moving them from AOL to a website the band owned as a means of “owning these relationships, not having them live outside our realm, our influence, our property.” Similarly, Zoë Keating, who as we have seen is more than willing to offer much of her private self to her audience through social media, speaks of getting all her fans to sign on to her mailing list “because I always want to own my fan base.” The language of ownership is a response to the platforms. At this historical juncture, one needn’t really question whether O’Connell was right that it was better for the band to own the community than for AOL to own it. As people increasingly let Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and a host of other platforms host their fan communities, more might follow his lead. At the same time, to think of fans as a thing you “own” is hardly a participatory stance.</p>
      <p>In his analysis of musicians’ official websites, Paul Théberge showed how they position audience members as consumers to be monetized and undermine the social practices that bind fans together, even as they provide fans with resources they want.<a id="en311r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en311">4</a> Official fan clubs of the early twentieth century were often run by fans, and often under the auspices of celebrities or, more likely, their staff. These clubs, with their newsletters and mailings, afforded a rare opportunity for musicians to engage their audiences outside of live events or mass mediation. They provided a way for fans to feel a sense of belonging to a larger fandom. Now, official websites serve this function, but when fans can so easily form communities on their own online, seeking to contain their engagement to sites you own sends power signals it did not before.</p>
      <p>Official sites are promotional resources for bands. They are also revenue sources. Most sell merchandise. Many offer direct access either to <a id="p112" class="page"></a>other fans or the musicians. Some artists use their official websites to organize fans into street teams who can help with local promotion. Lloyd Cole first gained his audience with a major label contract in the 1980s with his band the Commotions. He now has a long-standing group of “Young Idealists” organized through his site. Many acts sell preferential access to concert tickets and events like meet and greets before and after the show. Some bands also offer tiered pricing models. While this grants audiences more access to artists and one another than ever before, they also orient the status markers of fan communities even further toward money. The opportunities may be framed as connections, but “there is nevertheless a tendency on many club sites to equate fan commitment with dollars spent.”<a id="en312r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en312">5</a> Hersh’s subscription model, for example, offers different tiers of subscription at different rates. The most expensive option includes greater access to her. The Dave Mathews Band instituted a program giving long-term members of their websites better seats, as did Nine Inch Nails, who offered two levels of membership with better rewards at a higher cost.<a id="en313r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en313">6</a> This privileging of fans with money can rub some artists the wrong way. Marillion, seeking a more egalitarian model, has stuck to presales where everyone pays the same price for the forthcoming record they are funding and is entered into a raffle for the kinds of prizes high-tier fan funding might purchase for others.</p>
      <p>Well-intended official sites can undermine fan community by providing resources that fans would have traded to build community and status in their internal gift cultures. D. A. Wallach of Chester French—the first band on Facebook (they were Harvard students when and where the site first launched)—for instance, thought that the ideal official website (which he saw few artists, including himself, as attaining) should be “an extension of the fan experience,” but also “the absolute best place for you to go to get anything you need related to us. To find out any information about us, to see any pictures you want. It should be [that] anything related to us should not be accessible in better form anywhere else.” Sensible as this is, when artists are the ones to post things like set lists or other information, they move fans’ resources for building participatory relationships back under the bands’ control.<a id="en314r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en314">7</a></p>
      <p>Artists may territorialize fans’ creative practices as well, sponsoring or hosting select creative works by their audiences. As early as 1992, Madonna, always ahead of the curve, teamed with MTV to let fans submit<a id="p113" class="page"></a> videos for her song “True Blue.” The network broadcast the best for twenty-four hours.<a id="en315r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en315">8</a> In 2008, Coldplay held a contest for fans to produce a video for their song “Lost,” posting the winning entries on their website. While such contests validate fans’ creativity and productive capacities, it also ensures that intellectual property is managed on artists’ own terms. That the winners in contests like these are often professional or aspiring freelancers hoping to secure work through the exposure of winning is an ironic twist; there are nesting dolls of exploitation and precarity in these tales.</p>
      <p>Done well, fans can be quite happy about being territorialized. Housing fan practices on an official website that someone is committed to maintaining and managing (hopefully for pay) can provide the stability and longevity that let fan communities thrive. It can provide a bulwark against the rise and fall of different social media platforms and the precariousness of fan-driven sites and all the information and other resources they amass. As we will see, people can also foster participatory practices by setting some parts of their official sites, like the fan board, aside as a place for fans to do what they like. Yet creating an official site, using it to offer resources that then lose their social value within fan communities, and reshaping fan hierarchies through differential access based on wealth and willingness to be monetized, are inherently controlling actions and inevitably position audiences, at least in part, as markets to be managed.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0401" class="bh">Invoke Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
      <p class="paft">A considerably more aggressive way to seek power in relation to audience participation is to invoke the law, either as a lawsuit or the threat of one, to shut fans down. Many artists and even more labels and other rights holders use their intellectual property rights in efforts to keep the circulation of music, lyrics, images, and so on within boundaries they authorize. From a market perspective this makes perfect sense. Intellectual property is the core asset. Going after audiences for (mis)use of intellectual property reclaims power, wresting the ability to communicate as they wish away from audiences.</p>
      <p>The most delightfully perplexing exemplar of this was Prince. No one could build that lasting and adoring a fan base were he not adept at cultivating<a id="p114" class="page"></a> a relationship fans found deeply meaningful. He was known for participatory gestures like inviting fans into his home for parties. Yet, few have been quicker to turn to the law to limit fan practices online and off. Prince was rightly lauded for the control he demanded over his intellectual property and masters recordings in fights with his record label, but that same control turned toward fan practices, whether by him or his label, carried the message that he was the one in that relationship who wields the power. In a famous example, in 2007 he and Universal Music Group ordered YouTube to take down a clip of Stephanie Lenz’s baby dancing to his song “Let’s Go Crazy.” In turn, Lenz sued Prince and UMG for abusing takedown notices to squelch fair use.<a id="en316r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en316">9</a> Around the same time, he threatened three fan blogs—www.housequake.com, www.princefans.com, and www.prince.org (collectively referred to as “Prince Fans United”)—with legal action to stop them from sharing images of him and anything linked to his likeness. Among the offending images were photographs fans had posted of his face, tattooed on their own bodies. Prince Fans United refused to take down the sites, claiming the request was unlawful.<a id="en317r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en317">10</a> Prince and Universal backed down quickly and the issue was settled out of court, but all three sites disappeared. Prince was also notorious for sending cease-and-desist and takedown notices to platforms where fans shared his work, including the Pirate Bay, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In 2013, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (of which John Perry Barlow, Grateful Dead lyricist and early member of the WELL, was a co-founder and board member) awarded Prince its new “Lifetime Aggrievement Award” for “extraordinary abuses of the takedown process in the name of silencing speech,” an award many disputed.<a id="en318r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en318">11</a></p>
      <p>Prince was a huge star with people who could pursue legal claims for him and had the money to pay for it. That was not the case for most musicians I interviewed, or others who work closer to the margins. Some would have done so but lacked the time, expertise, and money to keep up with unauthorized uses of their intellectual property. Their tales of trying to exert legal claims were often endless games of bureaucratic whack-a-mole with opaque intermediaries. I spoke on a panel with the jazz composer, conductor, and artist rights activist Maria Schneider. She doesn’t see herself as going after her audiences, but she has testified before the U.S. Congress and elsewhere, arguing for policies to force platforms<a id="p115" class="page"></a> like YouTube to get her out of the Sisyphean task of requesting that her music be deleted item by item. David Lowery of Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven is also a vocal advocate for artists’ rights. He has often spoken out against platforms such as Google for earning income by embedding advertisements in search results for unauthorized downloads and YouTube (owned by Google) for hosting them. By 2015 he had turned much of his attention to Spotify, against which he filed and later settled a class-action lawsuit, alleging that they knowingly allowed streaming of songs to which they had not secured rights. Like territorializing as a means of protecting both artist and fans from platforms that may come and go, pursuing legal and policy action against platforms seems to be a power move against platforms rather than audiences. Yet it is audiences who are posting, looking for, and streaming those links artists seek to take down, and so any move against them is inevitably a move against the audience. It may be justified, but it is nonetheless a means of empowering one’s self at the audience’s expense.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0402" class="bh">Datafy</h3>
      <p class="paft">A third strategy for controlling audiences is to reduce them to data so they can be analyzed until they are predictable. Artists datafy audiences to inform their decision making and reduce risk.<a id="en319r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en319">12</a> James R. Beniger argues that the industrial age unleashed many technological and social forces that challenged the human ability to control what it created.<a id="en320r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en320">13</a> In response, people began to amass and exploit information on unprecedented scales, in what he called the “control revolution.” Media industries have long datafied audiences by counting them, historically with production numbers, sales counts, or measures of exposure.<a id="en321r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en321">14</a> Press and periodical runs were the first form of quantified audience measurement.<a id="en322r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en322">15</a> Since the 1970s, counting and related forms of measurement have become less intuitive and more systematic.<a id="en323r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en323">16</a> In music industries, audiences have traditionally been measured through sales and, to a lesser extent, radio exposure. Until the 1990s,<i> Billboard Magazine</i>’s charts, based on telephone surveys of record store personnel, were the industry standard. Big data came to the industry in 1991, when Mike Shalett and Mike Fine developed Soundscan (now part of Nielsen) to measure music audiences by tracking over-the-counter sales through bar codes.<a id="en324r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en324">17</a> <a id="p116" class="page"></a>Among the musicians discussed here, datafication takes many forms. Two of the most important are counting fans and mining their practices to assess their engagement and affective investments. As with using the law to stop fan practices, datafying audiences takes resources and skills that many artists may not have, even when individual platforms provide analytics they could use.</p>
      <p>Musicians have long datafied by collecting fan addresses. The Grateful Dead, not surprisingly, were pioneers in this as well. In 1971, four years after the release of their first album, they included an insert in their live <i>Skull and Roses</i> album asking people to send their name and address so they could keep them informed. They also hired a fan and gave him the duty of manning a booth at their concerts signing fans up to their mailing list. In the spring 1972 issue of the newsletter they sent to these fans, they expressed the hope that they could establish a communication system for all, but lamented that money had stopped them from realizing this inclusive vision. Within six months of putting the insert in the album, they had information on ten thousand fans. By 1976, they could sort sixty-three thousand fans by zip code and name. They further took control by establishing their own ticketing agency, and used this to build social bonds among the fans. Knowing who their fans were, how many shows they went to, and being the ones who sold and could hence choose where fans would be seated, the Dead were able to seat the most passionate fans up front, ensuring they would become familiar to one another and tightening the community on which they ultimately relied.<a id="en325r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en325">18</a> By the mid-1990s, when they finally converted their mailing list to email, they had five hundred thousand subscribers.<a id="en326r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en326">19</a></p>
      <p>Mailing lists require the conversion of fans into entries in a database that can then be managed and even estimated in terms of economic value. The fan management platform Topspin (which has since shut down) analyzed five years of “marketing and transactional data that has taken place across a sample set of over 29,000 artists who have used the Topspin platform to reach more than 57 million fans collectively.” They found that fans acquired through one of their campaigns (such as exchanging an email address to download a free song) were worth a “lifetime average value” of $3.78, although some artists realized more value and others less.<a id="en327r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en327">20</a> Most of the artists with whom I spoke rarely used the number of entries in the database as a means of demonstrating <a id="p117" class="page"></a>their economic value. For them, the size metrics such databases yielded were by-products of their desire to reach audiences directly.</p>
      <p>The advent of the internet and digital media, with all of their traces of previously ephemeral practices left by audiences, further amplified the trend toward datafication. Visible metrics of audience practices, things like counts of friends, followers, likes, replies, and retweets, make it easier than ever to think of audience members and practices as numbers. More sophisticated customer (aka fan) relations management (CRM) software now allows technoliterate musicians to do far more than count and sort by zip code. Wallach used Salesforce to develop software for managing their fans and quickly started modifying it for use by other artists. The platform allowed them to generate user reports, transform subscribers into segments, and target them using geography, demography, or any other “data points that we have on them.” Keating, like Wallach, is at ease with code. In an effort to understand and more effectively communicate with her audiences, she exported her audience information from different platforms and compared them. She found only five hundred overlapping fans between her two Facebook pages (the personal and the fan), a different set of people altogether on MySpace, and a third group on her mailing list. This helped her understand the differences between the audiences and the need “to talk to them differently.”</p>
      <p>These datafication strategies work by quantifying data fans provide on the artists’ profiles or sites they control. Today, artists and those working with them must monitor far more than their own territories if they are to make sense of their audiences. Both manual eavesdropping and more sophisticated tools like sentiment mining and machine learning can be used to analyze who audiences are and what they are saying across the internet. Wallach kept an eye on communication about the band using a variety of tools including Google Alerts, RSS feeds from Twitter, IceRocket (“kind of like a social search engine”), and links people sent him in email messages, trying to “cast my net as wide as possible.” Ariel Rivas, who manages a roster of acts from Central and South America, talks about his and his team’s daily rituals of mining and managing data to help focus publicity, plan tours and ticket prices, and identify and build relationships with fan leaders to reach his artists’ audiences. Rivas uses every tool he can: TweetDeck, which he describes as “incredible,” “like having three or four million reporters connected and sending data <a id="p118" class="page"></a>to you,” Facebook demographics, and Google Analytics. When we spoke he was also using Topspin. He described his work with Rubén Blades:</p>

        <p class="bqs">We’re monitoring what happens on all the social networks and on Twitter, and we know that we have a huge amount of fans in Venezuela. We know that, because we have a lot of hits from Venezuela. Or we have a lot of fans in Colombia, and we can do more publicity or we can sell our shows at a higher price in that country. . . . So, now we have a lot of tools to know what exactly is happening in each market. In the old days, they didn’t have that ability to know what happened in each market. You just had to call the radio stations.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Datafication can be powerful but, like the law, can remain out of reach for artists working on their own or with fewer resources. Historically, musicians have rarely had access to their own sales figures, and though they can certainly see the size of their live audiences when they perform, know how many people subscribe to their mailing list or fan club, or view the numbers of likes their messages and accounts garner, it can be difficult (or uninteresting) for them to develop the computational skills to maintain audience databases or the critical analytic skills to best interpret the kinds of numbers that digital metrics and data analytics provide.<a id="en328r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en328">21</a> Mark Kelly, who, as we will see below, exploited Marillion’s large fan mailing list to finance much of their career, knew the importance of collecting names and addresses, but did a poor job of maintaining them. “Unfortunately, when people left we would just destroy their details, we never kept it all. So there’s probably thousands and thousands of people who went through the fan club, we have no idea who they were because we weren’t so clued up about the sort of things that you should be doing.” Many musicians I spoke with had lost their audience data at least once. When platforms, fan management systems, and the tools used to make sense of audience activities online routinely change or go under, musicians move from one to another, often losing their datafication work as they do.</p>
      <p>Wallach is well educated, interested in business, and excited about technology. Keating worked in computing before turning full time to music. But most musicians, like most people, are poorly equipped to access, move, manage, or interpret the data it takes to track and measure their own audiences. Without support to help them, musicians <a id="p119" class="page"></a>may feel overwhelmed rather than empowered by the relentless flow of data. Mike Timmins, of Cowboy Junkies, sees the flow of metrics. He’s “sure there’s a way of figuring them out and looking at that stuff.” But he doesn’t feel he’s got the resources: “God, who knows how to do that? And who has—and that’s more time. That’s more time involved. I think if you had a team of guys working on your website, which I’m sure some of the bigger bands do and their labels should but they probably don’t, yeah, all that stuff could be figured out. I mean, it’s always there. All those metrics and all those tools are there to do that stuff, but, God, I can’t even be. . . . It’s hard enough to just do a blog, never mind do all that stuff.”</p>
      <p>These strategies—territorializing, invoking intellectual property rights, and datafying—are routinely deployed to transform the unwieldy and unpredictable lived experiences of human beings in their audiences into discrete phenomena that can be understood from a distance and manipulated. Even as they objectify and undermine, they can also enhance fans’ experiences as individuals and as communities. But perfect control is an unattainable ideal, hampered by labels that may keep data hidden from artists (see chapter 2); expense; the challenges of managing, analyzing, and meaningfully interpreting data; and, as I turn to now, the simultaneous competing desire to approach audiences not as objects to be used but as communities meant for participation.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0402" class="ah">Strategies of Participation</h2>
      <p class="paft">Music, as a social practice, is inherently participatory. This pull toward participation in a business that requires control can cause frictions for commercial artists. UB40, for example, had an official fan club early on but stopped because they found it embarrassing. Growing up in a working-class city amid strong worker solidarity movements, having a fan club felt too much like a power trip. “We all find it a bit disingenuous, you know, I mean, a little weird,” Brian Travers told me:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">But remember we’re like raving socialists. We love nothing more than going on marches against, you know, right wing, they were called the National Front then in Britain, the British National Party, the BNP. So having a fan club, it just felt a little bit too Duran Duran. Nice guys, and I don’t mean that, but you know, it’s having that commercial mind. I mean, <a id="p120" class="page"></a>we put a website up. We have a bulletin board, you know, a forum, and we try to play the game a little. But I do prefer just talking to people, you know what I mean? Do you know?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Egalitarian, participatory socialists that they want to be, they still feel the need to “try to play the game a little.” The only way musicians can avoid controlling strategies is to opt out of capitalism. The rest, like Travers, have to find ways to insert participation into a media industry structure that has left a legacy of centralized control and market thinking. The two main ways of doing this are to accept fans’ autonomy and, as Hersh did, incorporate them into your business plans as collaborators as well as customers.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0403" class="bh">Accept Autonomy</h3>
      <p class="paft">The controlling strategies of territorializing and invoking intellectual property rights seek to manage where audiences practice their fandom and which practices they are allowed to do there. When artists accept audience autonomy, they leave fans to their own devices to do their own things, either providing a home for, ignoring, or explicitly supporting them as they do. Throwing Muses may have territorialized, but when they moved fans to ThrowingMusic.com, they designed the site to give each fan a profile page of their own and a forum to allow them to continue their discussion on the same terms they had on AOL. Official websites like this often make space to foster “a sense of belonging” alongside a space for direct marketing.<a id="en329r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en329">22</a> Artists cede power by giving fans a space and letting them use it as they like, yet just as a Facebook fan page belongs ultimately to Facebook rather than the artist, an official website belongs ultimately to the artist rather than the fans. This can be a source of conflict. Billy Bragg has an active and long-lasting fan forum on his official site. “It’s real autonomous,” he says. “Sometimes they get pissed off with me and they criticize me or I do stuff that they don’t particularly like for whatever reason.” Sometimes their arguments with him are political, but sometimes they have to do with changes that have been made to the forum they see as theirs.</p>
      <p>A more participatory way to accept autonomy is to accept that fans create their own places for discussion, either on their own sites or <a id="p121" class="page"></a>through social network platforms, and either encourage them to do so or leave them alone. The fan site I relied on when I fell in love with Sivert Høyem’s band, Madrugada, was created by a fan (see chapter 3). Madrugada and their management knew about the site and, feeling (correctly, alas) that they “sucked at the internet,” they decided it was better to leave them alone. Though there were rumors that some people who worked with the band were present on the board sometimes, if the musicians ever came by, they hid it well.</p>
      <p>Mogwai likewise let a fan-run site serve in place of an official fan forum. They knew the person who ran it, and looked at it to see what people were saying, but left its management in the fan’s hands. “I don’t think we would have the time to moderate that. Although they do a good job, so maybe we could just get them to do it for us,” Stuart Braithwaite mused. “But I think it’s better that they should have their thing because I think if it was our own board, I don’t know, you kind of feel tempted to kind of have no one say anything negative and I think that kind of wouldn’t really be fair.” A few artists, such as Franz Ferdinand, actively encourage fans to create their own spaces. Their official website links out to more than fifty fan sites around the internet on websites and social media platforms including Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. Artists may not necessarily approve of what happens on these sites, but when they have chosen to accept autonomy, they let it be. One musician I spoke with complained about the fans’ internal hierarchy, which seemed to exclude new fans:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">That whole thing kind of freaked me out a little bit, because it seemed like they really claimed the band for themselves. “A fan since 1999” or something. You didn’t have a right to take part, and it all had to be done in this very kind of correct tone. They had their own kind of way of writing messages to each other and stuff. I liked to think that that wasn’t what our fans were like. To be honest, I didn’t really—I didn’t like that much, that whole thing, and the way they tried to reduce it to just very detailed nerdy things. It turned into a club.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Another expressed distress at watching fans bully and compete with one other on Twitter, wanting to intervene, but knowing it was likely to cause more trouble than resolution.</p>
      <p><a id="p122" class="page"></a>Musicians may also take participatory stances toward uses of their intellectual property by encouraging their audiences to share and create new things with them and their music. Again, the Grateful Dead led the way, nurturing the tape trading networks their fans were creating by establishing taping sections at concerts and encouraging fans to share their recordings. The artists I spoke with had mixed feelings about letting their audiences share recordings of either their albums or concerts, but, with exceptions like the artists’ rights advocates I described earlier, they generally saw the free circulation of music as having long passed the point of no return. Some who had opposed it made their peace. The Australian DJ Deepchild, who lives and works in Germany, described how his feelings toward this had changed. “I used to feel really very defensive about that notion and now I almost feel the opposite. I’m happy for people to take my music for free whenever they want.” Some were just resigned to a fate they found unfortunate but no longer worth fighting.</p>
      <p>Artists also have mixed feelings on people sharing concert recordings. It is common to suppress this from the start. Some put up signs requesting that the show not be photographed or even use third-party companies to render mobile phones unusable for the duration of a show. Others, like the drummer of a prominent indie band I spoke with, “don’t care about any of that” and “think that’s fine.”</p>
      <p>I shared with him what Nacho Vegas had told me about his trouble balancing his desire to control his music with politics that support audience power. “The audience has got more power than you, so it’s great but it’s strange. You know when you play live, it’s something that happens in that moment and you don’t think it could be like in the web. So it’s just strange. Sometimes I think ‘I wish I never played this song’ because now it’s in the web and I don’t like it the way I played. But I think I have to change my mind, because it’s great that people have these phones. I don’t know, it’s strange for me.”</p>
      <p>The drummer laughed, “yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, practice more.” You can’t change it, he says, “you’ve just got to get your head around it and deal with it because it’s not changing. It’s not going to go back to where people don’t post those things.” I think of my son’s reaction to signs at a Bryan Ferry concert explaining that cell phone pictures were forbidden: “Who is he to think he can exempt himself from the modern world?” Indeed, the minute Ferry took the stage, out came the cameras.</p>
      <p><a id="p123" class="page"></a>Martin Thörnkvist, who manages Swedish singer Moto Boy, had only enthusiasm for these fan practices. It is no coincidence that for a time he shared an office with a founder of the Pirate Bay. He looked for fan concert videos, downloading the best versions of each song and compiling them into a YouTube concert. We could say that Thörnkvist was being controlling, harvesting fan work for promotion, but we can just as honestly say that he not only left fans to do their own thing, he brought Moto Boy into their participatory realm by recirculating their work on his behalf.</p>
      <p>Audiences also exploit intellectual property by transforming it into their own creative work, including videos, art, remixes, and fan fiction in which musicians are cast as protagonists in tales that may include fantasies of romantic and sexual relationships that do not exist. The artists I spoke with did not always like the results. Some thought fans’ creative works were unimaginative; others thought it was not appropriate. One, who found fan fiction featuring her having sex with a friend of hers, found it downright creepy. “I have Google Analytics for my name,” she told me. “I’ll check once a week.” The week before we talked, a piece of fan fiction had come up featuring her and a female friend in another band. It was “so disturbing.”</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">It was just this really, really disturbing sex scene between us. And then at the end, you know, all these kids can comment on it, and someone says like “Oh, that was very smart and very classy.” And then another girl goes “Oh, what a great pair.” And that kind of thing just really, really weirds me out. Like I haven’t seen [my friend] yet since I read it, but I’m probably going to feel weird even when I see her, even though she’s not involved in it at all. But it’s just like one of those like weird, creepy obsessive kind of things.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Most tolerated these kinds of fan creativity, some wished their fans did more of it, and some celebrated what their fans made. For Kristin Hersh, witnessing (some of) her audience’s creativity proved both surprising and profoundly rewarding: “I didn’t know they’d be willing to come through with their own projects like remixes of my songs, time lapse paintings to my music, films, covers, all of that sharing they do, all that effort and all that involvement. It’s one thing to be made someone’s <a id="p124" class="page"></a>soundtrack for a while, that is truly the highest honor I could ever hope to achieve. And they go one step closer to making the music together by actually making the music together.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I also asked Stephen Mason what he thought about practices like fan art. “Oh, I think it’s cool,” he said without hesitation. Honestly, it’s people getting involved and interested in finding ways to—in its own way, it’s a response. It’s a response. These days, it would be foolish to just say anything other than, ‘I’m excited that people are engaging.’” Art, he added, “can continue to grow and develop into new things, all the time. All the time, depending on how people engage it.”</p>
      <h3 id="bh0404" class="bh">Let Them Help</h3>
      <p class="paft">Musicians, especially smaller and independent ones without significant industry investment in their careers, can feel overwhelmed by the amount of work to be done and the omniprofessionalism their career <a id="p125" class="page"></a>now demands. Like Hersh before her Strange Angels, they can also have trouble finding the money for recording costs. Fan communities operate on principles of gift exchange, in which obligations are balanced through the giving and receiving of resources. Listeners often feel embedded in an exchange relationship in which they owe the artist a debt for what the music has meant in their lives.<a id="en330r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en330">23</a> Such fans can be happy to balance out their debt by working on musicians’ behalf, whether that is through actual tasks or direct funding. Artists who use collaborative strategies based on this fan desire to help invite audience members to participate in the “art worlds” of musicking (described in chapter 2), where there are always roles to play and always work to be done.</p>
      <p>Letting audiences participate has symbolic value in the relationship above and beyond any actual help they provide. After eight albums on a major label and three with an independent, Marillion did the math and realized that at the rates they were being paid, they had to record an album a year. They left their label. Remembering that fans had come up with the idea of directly financing their North American tour a few years earlier, Kelly saw a solution. “What about all these fans that gave us all this money a few years ago?” he asked. “Why don’t we see if anybody would be interested in buying the album in advance of us making it, like a sort of preorder, advanced order?” He knew it would take a “leap of faith,” a “trust” in the band—preorder was a novel idea at the time—but he also knew they had “fans that have been with us, some of them for 25 years or whatever, that given the opportunity they’d like to show their appreciation.” The mailing list they had spent years building had twenty-three thousand subscribers. When they offered the presale, they got advance orders for thirteen thousand, enough to finance the album <i>Anoraknophobia</i>, released in 2001. They then took the finished product to their former label, EMI, who distributed it to retail outlets on terms far more comfortable to the band.</p>
      <p>After doing this for a few more albums, Marillion had enough money saved to fund their own album production. They decided it was “cheeky” to keep going back to fans whose money they didn’t actually need. “I think I was probably wrong at the time,” Kelly reflects, “but I said, it feels a bit like when you go to a friend and ask for a bit of help. ‘Can you lend me some money?’ and they lend you some money. And then you go back again and you say, ‘Oh well actually we need you to lend <a id="p126" class="page"></a>us some money again.’” They decided to self-fund the next record. Fans were angry and disappointed. “There was all that stuff which made them feel, one, financially they knew they were financing it and two, they were very much involved with the whole process as it was going along. So there was a sense of disappointment I think that we didn’t do it. People felt that somehow it wasn’t as special.” The band returned to presales, not because they needed the money, but because it gave fans a sense of participating in “the whole process.”</p>
      <p>Pay-what-you-want models are another strategy that simultaneously acknowledges fans as customers, yet gives them room to transform their act of paying from transactional to participatory. The most famous example of this remains Radiohead’s 2007 experiment, in which they offered people the opportunity to choose their own price (including nothing) for their surprise album <i>In Rainbows</i>. The average price paid was considerably less than the album later sold for in stores, but at an estimated $2.40 per download going directly to the band, they likely made more money than they would have from their previous label, EMI.<a id="en331r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en331">24</a> Entire labels have chosen to do this, like Conner Oberst’s Saddle Creek label. “We appeal to common sense,” Oberst said. “If you can afford something you like, you’ll buy it because that benefits the person who created the thing you like.”<a id="en332r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en332">25</a> Intermediary platforms may also offer the ability to overpay. Magnatune, with the motto “We are not evil,” recommended that customers pay eight dollars for each album on their site (splitting the proceeds fifty-fifty with the rights holders) but let customers choose a price between five dollars and eighteen dollars. Regner and Barria found that only 14.5 percent of customers paid the minimum price.<a id="en333r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en333">26</a> Most paid the suggested price. On average, though, they paid $8.20. Regner and Barria’s survey of customers found that the biggest reasons for paying more than the minimum were a desire to support the artist, a sense of guilt at paying less than the recommended, and a desire to restore reciprocity.</p>
      <p>The solo bassist Steve Lawson makes his (plentiful) recordings available through the direct-sales intermediary Bandcamp, which allows him to set a price of free, yet gives fans the opportunity to pay as much as they like. He also uses the platform to sell limited-edition, specially designed USB sticks containing his entire collected works for twenty pounds. For some time now, Bandcamp sales have paid his rent. Bandcamp urges musicians using the site to leave the “let fans pay more if <a id="p127" class="page"></a>they want” option checked, advising them that “fans pay more than the minimum a whopping 40% of the time, driving up the average price paid by nearly 50% (in fact, every day, we see überfans paying $50, $100, $200 for albums priced far lower).”<a id="en334r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en334">27</a> By 2016, fans had paid artists nearly two hundred million dollars through Bandcamp, buying a record every three seconds.<a id="en335r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en335">28</a></p>
      <p>David Lowery has not pursued direct fan funding for music, but he used it for the blog posts he used to write about the stories behind his songs. Beside each article was a tip jar, which netted him around two hundred dollars, sometimes more, per post. If he were the “idealized economically rational person,” he tells me, “I would actually not play Sunday through Wednesday and instead write my blog.” Wikström argues that tip jars are unlikely to become the norm.<a id="en336r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en336">29</a> Indeed, after giving them a try, YouTube removed them as an official feature in late 2016. However, the potential of direct micropayments outside direct purchasing remains underexplored.</p>
      <p>Artists may also encourage fans to participate in promotion and the many tasks of pulling off a career in music today. Fans are great marketers, ever willing to convert their “desire to express themselves through the music” into free publicity.<a id="en337r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en337">30</a> As Lowery put it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">You actually enlist certain sort of self-appointed fans, basically to do much of the actual work that bands relied on record labels, and publicists, and other professionals to do. You sort of have this informal—like “get the news out on this,” “tell your friends about this,” “here’s the link to buy tickets, pass it around.” . . . That was a lot of the work of managers, publicists, record labels, et cetera, did in the past. And now you have this other kind of exchange going on where you’re sort of enlisting people that could do work for you.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Rivas, whose artists have audiences in many countries but may not live in well-connected nations themselves, relies on such audience collaborations. Speaking of Cuban artist Silvio Rodriguez, he says: “They don’t have these high-speed internet connections to start connecting every day and put posts. They post interviews, but I think they need the fans to be more creative and post information about them. A lot of information you find on the internet are fans’ postings, no? And that’s the important <a id="p128" class="page"></a>part of the fans, because the fans are working with you to maintain your life.” Rivas also uses the data flows around his artists to identify influential audience members. When he saw that a Rubén Blades fan in Chile had created a Facebook fan page with a hundred thousand followers, he contacted the fan, thanked him for “the wonderful work,” and asked him to “be part of us.” His organization sent him “albums, tickets, and flowers,” and kept him updated on news and events in hopes he would share that information with the fans he had organized.</p>
      <p>Fans also provide technical and logistical support, from providing couches to sleep on to website management. Lloyd Cole described how his community has “been a great help” to him. After he shut down his MySpace page,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">I got an email, or notes through my website, from various people saying, “If you’d like, we’ll run your MySpace page for you.” So they do. I have a guy in Glasgow called Paul who runs my MySpace page, and he puts all my—anything I put on the website to do with concerts, he keeps it all up to date. He uploads the latest songs and things. I basically have a great MySpace page, and I don’t do anything. He also actually helps me with Google Maps for the venues when the tours are announced. He puts all the venues on my Google Maps so that I can plan hotels and things.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">“That’s just a volunteer who just loves you and wants to give back?” I ask.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I’ve got several volunteers who do various things. I’ve got this group called the Young Idealists, and they sell CDs for me at concerts and they put up posters in coffee shops and bars and things. And one of them actually is a JavaScript expert. I did nearly all of the coding at my website, but I couldn’t make the music player work with Flash, and it turned out to be a JavaScript problem, and another Paul in Glasgow, whose regular gig is a philosophy professor and he’s a part-time web designer, he fixed the JavaScript issues for me. So he’s another person I’m greatly indebted to.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule told me she’s “had a couple people that were like fanatic kind of and could be kind of a touch stalky or weird.” But then, “I just put them to work and then they stop being weird. And <a id="p129" class="page"></a>now some, they’re like free employees.” “I’m kind of being humorous,” she adds, “but it was just you had a feeling like this person was, you know, just passionate, but they’re actually a sane kind of person that might have a skill that could help you in exchange for something.” One fan designed her web page. Another road-managed her for a few shows. A third translated a song of hers into French for a concert in Paris.</p>

      <h3 id="bh0405" class="bh">Challenges of Participation</h3>
      <p class="paft">Much as they may seem to promote equality and participation, participatory strategies that rely on fans’ sense of gift economics can be <a id="p130" class="page"></a>threatening to artists. They may think that accepting gifts turns them into beggars or blurs the professional and personal boundaries that should separate them from their audiences. Amanda Palmer describes the fear of seeking fan funding as a concern about “being seen as a burdensome member of the community instead of a productive one,” echoing Kelly’s concern about being “cheeky” by going back to the fans asking repeatedly for money.<a id="en338r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en338">31</a> Norwegian metal frontman Sindre Solem of Nekromantheon sees fan funding as “kind of begging.” He told me: “I’ve seen some bands say, please preorder and pay now for the exclusive LP, and you will get like, a bonus hat or whatever, signed, and they need the preorders to actually pay for the pressing of the LP. I don’t know what I think about that, actually. I wouldn’t do it myself. I don’t think it’s classy.” Inviting fans to participate can make you feel too indebted, too powerless relative to audiences. Gifts are often ambivalent.</p>
      <p>Participatory strategies that invoke gift economics can also leave musicians with social obligations that would not be there were the transactions clearly bounded by market economics, with terms of exchange explicit. Gift exchanges bind people together socially and even intimately by creating the feeling that having received, you must now give.<a id="en339r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en339">32</a> The artist Sal Randolph argues that “the relational nature of the gift economy is both its strength and its constraint.<a id="en340r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en340">33</a> It both establishes relationship and requires relationship. The market economy works on the principle of even exchange. Every transaction is complete in itself, balanced, leaving the participants free of each other. But while the gift economy is free in terms of money, it is constrained by the qualities and requirements of human social relationships.”</p>
      <p>The sense of obligation recurs in all of the stories of collaboration artists tell. They will fund you, but you better keep them in the loop after you do. They will market for you, do technical support for you, translate for you, but they may feel you owe them a spot on the guest list, albums, flowers. You are, as Cole put it, “greatly indebted.” When gifts are offered as contributions to the group, failing to show appropriate emotion or gratitude can be a kind of “antipayment” with the potential to create hostility.<a id="en341r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en341">34</a> Lowery finds that using fans as free promotional labor is “where it gets weird, because the fans sort of think of it as this friendship, and actually what you’re doing is actually kind of not really manipulating them, but you’ve been using them to get your information,<a id="p131" class="page"></a> your art, you’re using them to promote your band, basically. And sometimes fans think it’s more friendship, and it’s not, really. And so that’s weird and awkward.”</p>

      <p>For some artists, the dialectic of walking this line between a job that is easier when fans participate and keeping those fans at a distance never stops being challenging. Lloyd Cole, for instance, describes his “incredibly active” fans as “something like a second family, not what I set out to have.” When I ask what he set out to have, he answers, “an audience.” The process of moving from audience to second family, a move away from control toward participation that feels much more intimate, took Cole “through various levels of uncomfortableness.” The relational labor required to maintain it remains both necessary and delicate.</p>
      <p>Lowery’s solution to this conundrum is to “just kind of be a little more honest about relationships.” He encourages fans to participate at the business level but leaves the social worlds of participation to the fans alone: “What I try to do instead of that is to encourage the personal relationship between everybody that are fans, and the fans that are helping<a id="p132" class="page"></a> you out, and essentially helping you promote your band or whatever like that. To encourage fans to develop friendships among themselves. It becomes a very tightknit strong community if it’s done properly, but, do you know what I mean? And that’s indeed a reward.”</p>
      <p>For fans, participating through funding or other assistance may feel exploitative, especially if the artists profit too much or turn on them, but it can also be a means of participating in an art world that matters in their lives. Free labor is not necessarily exploited labor, writes Tiziana Terranova in her foundational article on free digital labor; it is also “willingly conceded in exchange for the pleasures of communication and exchange.”<a id="en342r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en342">35</a></p>
      <p>Participation also raises challenges for artistic integrity. For centuries, art has been associated with lone geniuses and “authentic and autonomous subjectivity.”<a id="en343r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en343">36</a> In many genres, the “authenticity” audiences prize depends on a belief that the music was created free from market pressures, including listener preferences. Many artists, even the most participatory, thus draw the line at letting audiences participate in the creation of the actual music, a point even made by Amanda Palmer, who spends an entire book extolling the virtues of a participatory communal approach to audience. Some artists will actively invite audience participation in song or album-crafting but still draw a line at composition. Sydney Wayser, for instance, solicited input on which finished songs should go on the album and in what order. “They’re the ones that I want to buy the record so I want them to like it. I’m going to take into account everyone’s favorite songs and their opinions, but if one person gives me a track list and I really don’t think it’s the right way to go, I don’t have to keep it. So at the end of the day I feel like I still have the creative power of attorney, it’s still my project and I can kind of pick what I want.”</p>
      <p>Jazz singer/guitarist Kate Schutt went further than this when she invited her audience to send her love stories for an album she was writing. “It was a cool thing,” she said. “I had incredible conversations with the people, with my fans that submitted things by email.” She was shocked by the power of what they sent:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">people submitted the most honest, heart wrenching, beautiful, they were so—I don’t even know how to describe it. They were so forthright and so willing to share some very deep, personal moments with me. I was <a id="p133" class="page"></a>shocked, and I never thought I would get what I got. You know, beautiful sort of stream of consciousness elegies. The love story could be about anything. It could be about a place, a person, a street, a time period in your life, a person living or dead, famous, not famous, family not family, whatever. And so, I got beautiful first person stream of conscious elegies about somebody’s dying grandmother to little scribbled notes about a street corner to, like I said, works of art to love affairs, you know, secret love affairs, to total erotic things that shocked my pants off, anonymously submitted soft porn, basically. I mean, you know, I was shocked. I was totally shocked. It was so cool.</p>

      <p>But when it came to composition, could she “take a letter and mark that A and then take a song for the new album and mark that B and draw a straight line between them? No. We can’t do that.” But</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">was I in an ongoing conversation with myself and my fans about what makes a great song? Yes. Their letters were the reason I was doing that. <a id="p134" class="page"></a>Now, I always have that going on in my head when I’m writing. I mean, I’m critical. I’m a critical reader and thinker about—and so do I always have that going on? Sure, I do. But I had a reason to do it, you know, every week. So do I think it made the songs on <i>The Telephone Game</i> what I consider to be my strongest songs yet and my most pers—that most sound like me, where I hit the target of what I’m trying to do more closely, you know, closer to the center? Yes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Another musician told me that their “artistic vision has to remain independent of what the fans want. We’ll listen, but it has to still remain independent.” “You have to be true to what you want to do,” said another. “You have to make your own music the way it comes out. And if there’s an audience, very great. If there isn’t, then it’s too bad.” “I think the only way to be honest with your audience,” said Nacho Vegas, “is not giving power to your audience. When I make songs for a new album I try not to—I am in my home alone and I try not to think about this thing of some people saying you are good or you are not. It’s my duty, you know, to make songs as if nobody will listen to them. I try to make something in this pure way and songs that come from you but songs that have nothing to do about what people think of it or your audience or something like that.”</p>
      <h2 id="ah0403" class="ah">Straddling Unattainable Ideals</h2>
      <p class="paft">Musicians seeking to make money making music are caught in a relational dialectic between the unrealizable ideals of control and participation. No amount of territorializing, takedown notices, data, or sophisticated algorithms will ever overcome the essential unpredictability and risk of music careers, even when presented in dashboards with easy-to-read interfaces. Audiences are too unruly and empowered to be controlled. Managing and understanding them takes time and skills most people lack. Yet control remains a potent motivation. The fact that we cannot attain perfect control does not mean we can’t do it at all. We can put people, things, and ourselves into order and make them subject to coordination. Indeed, we must. Artists, like all of us, need to be able to detach from and objectify others, making Yous into Its as they make <a id="p135" class="page"></a>sense of their audiences and strategically try to build, maintain, and earn money from them.</p>
      <p>Participation too is fraught. It is desirable, yet cannot be fully realized within market systems that rely on the depersonalizing principles of economic exchange. Furthermore, when the ground shifts away from control toward participation, the relational principles on which artists and their audiences operate change too. Audience participation can leave artists who might otherwise welcome it feeling too needy, too intimate for comfort, or as if their artistic autonomy, and hence integrity, has been compromised. The lived experience of the participation/control dialectic is thus one of ambivalence. Every action inherently implicates both participation and control, and often in ways that sit beside one another uneasily. Hersh has found a balance that lets her flourish musically while enhancing her fans’ attachments to one another and to her. She remains poor and her commitment to her subscribers leaves her little time off, but she got her religion back. Even when it’s successful, balancing this dialectic and finding a power balance between artist and audience that works for both takes effort. The relational labor of managing ambivalence through facilitating, tolerating, enclosing, and limiting audience practices is never done.</p>
