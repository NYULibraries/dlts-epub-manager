      <h1 class="ct">Relational Boundaries</h1>
      <p class="pf">Once upon a time, as this book began, musicians could “disappear into a mansion for years,” “dropping out of the sky” on rare occasions to bless their audiences with new records and tours. Now, “they’re tweeting about what they had for breakfast.” Millennial music fans, raised on social media, expect musicians to be constantly available to them, offering unique, personal glimpses of offstage life. They see musicians as “friends” and “crave intimate glimpses into mundane daily activities.” The more musicians are open about who they are, the more connected these fans say they feel.<a id="en403r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en403">1</a> Fans want a “glimpse into inner life,” they want “access, intimacy, and affiliation.”</p>
      <p>Zoë Keating is a musician at ease with these demands. She doesn’t distinguish between a private self and her musician self: “I don’t see a distinction. It’s like I’m an individual and I happen to have this creative life. There is no distinction. I think that’s why social media is so—I find it—I’m kind of facile. It’s sort of easy for me because I don’t have to think up like ‘is that my inside voice or my outside voice.’ For better or worse they’re the same voice.” But inside and outside voices are not the same for everyone, and, as this chapter will explore, finding a voice that strikes the right balance between “access, intimacy, and affiliation” and privacy, distance, and autonomy often requires ongoing relational labor.</p>
      <p>In many genres, including indie, blues, country, hip-hop, jazz, and soul, musicians have long been judged in terms of whether they are “authentic” and “real,” but the standards of realness have changed.<a id="en404r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en404">2</a> Since music became industrialized in the nineteenth century, fans have “sought to understand stars as authentic people, with whom they had an intimate bond.”<a id="en405r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en405">3</a> Like the love of “liveness,” this fascination with authenticity can be traced to mediation. “‘Disembedded’ out of their immediate experiential contexts of face-to-face interaction by the modern music media,” authenticity became a way to recreate a personal sense of social relationships.<a id="en406r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en406">4</a></p>
      <p><a id="p172" class="page"></a>From the earliest days of the music industries, authenticity has been essential to marketing. Musicians have been sold as ordinary people, just like us, except photographed at home by <i>Life</i> magazine in somewhat nicer homes. In images and in sound, this kind of authenticity depended on believable performances that came off “as natural and effortless.” Musicians have also been sold as larger than life, cultural avatars with whom audiences might identify, to which they might aspire, or whom they might find exotic and alluring. In this sense, an “authentic” musician is one who credibly conforms “to an idealized representation of reality,” qualified to speak as a legitimate member of a subculture. Whole genres have been built on such mythologies. In either sense, far from given, authenticity is socially constructed. As Negus argues: “Songs and musical styles do not simply ‘reflect, ‘speak to’ or ‘express’ the lives of audience members or musicians. A sense of identity is created out of and across the processes whereby people are connected together through and with music.” Authenticity “is never an objective quality inherent in things, but simply a shared set of beliefs about the nature of things we value in the world.” Its meaning changes as it is “renegotiated in a continual political struggle in which the goal of each contending interest is to naturalize a particular construction of authenticity.”<a id="en407r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en407">5</a></p>
      <p>The standards by which authenticity has been judged in music have had little to do with an individual’s inner self, but everything to do with social positioning, from the independent label to which one is (or is not) signed to the color of one’s skin. As a general rule, the further musicians are from commercial pressures, the more authentic they are seen to be. Audiences of many genres use “demographic profiling” to test for authenticity. It “is said that to play bluegrass a musician must be white, working-class, rural and preferably from the Appalachian Mountains; you must be young, white, and an underachiever to perform punk music; and all salsa musicians must be Latin American.”<a id="en408r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en408">6</a> I’m old enough to remember the career-destroying ridicule Vanilla Ice faced when he was revealed to be an affluent kid from the suburbs rather than the streetwise tough guy he sold audiences.</p>
      <p>Today, musicians encounter a third sense of being real, which is to communicate with audiences as you would with friends. The aloof-yet-authentic star has been replaced by a new ideal, musicians who openly share their private selves by routinely communicating with audiences <a id="p173" class="page"></a>about their everyday life. Why settle for a magazine publishing a photograph of you at home when you can pull out your phone at home and invite your audience in? The new standard for “authenticity” is using your inside voice with everyone.</p>
      <p>As we will see in this chapter, this demands the relational labor of developing strategies for choosing when and when not to communicate with audiences. Musicians need strategies for deciding which of the continuous incoming stream of invitations to conversation they will engage. They need to learn when and how to shut a conversation down. They also need strategies for managing topics in ways that let them create a presence that feels close but not too close, or, as one musician put it, “having boundaries without having the appearance of having boundaries.” Being “real” with audiences can bring life-enriching consequences, especially when musicians express themselves as they want to be and are rewarded with affirmation and affection. But letting audiences in also makes musicians vulnerable. Their identities are at stake, both as professionals, able to accomplish their musical magic, and as they know and want themselves to be in the privacy of their homes.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0601" class="ah">Being Real</h2>
      <p class="paft">The call to intimacy can be traced to cultural histories of commodifying feeling that transcend music, from flight attendants paid to smile to expectations of casual conversation in service contexts (see introduction). Intimacy, once a private source of refuge from utilitarian pursuits, came to be a tool for accomplishing those pursuits by the 1940s. As it did, cultural ideologies shifted away from maintaining formal distance in public toward engaging in less restrained interactions more like those of private contexts. Richard Sennett describes an ideology of intimacy that arose in the mid-twentieth century premised on the idea that “relationships of all kinds are real, believable, and authentic the closer they approach the inner psychological concerns of each person.”<a id="en409r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en409">7</a> This dovetailed with the rise of the “new economy” from the 1970s onward, in which workers, less likely to find lasting employment, felt more pressure to be entrepreneurial, increasing the need to build relationships and create aesthetic, emotional, and social experiences for customers across a wide range of fields.</p>
      <p><a id="p174" class="page"></a>As the last chapter argued, the new demand for intimacy can also be traced in part to the relational affordances of social media, which favor a norm of “personal authenticity and connection.” This norm takes shape in subtle social pressures, as well as explicit messages about how to use social media. Twitter’s official advice for musicians, for instance, emphasizes “authenticity”: “For performers, connecting with your fans in an authentic way is one key to your success,” it reads. “A Twitter connection tells fans how much you appreciate them, and it also enables you to tailor your messages. The fact is, Twitter provides more authenticity and creative control than any other online medium. Tweets come straight from you, and go right to your followers all over the world, in real-time.” When maintaining “authentic” connection has become the norm, musicians who don’t take advantage of social media to create ongoing relationships with fans seem uncaring and unavailable.</p>
      <p>Musicians hear this new call to intimacy. “Twitter and Facebook’s microblogging aspect kind of demanded fresh personal content,” says singer-songwriter Erin McKeown, “and I have certainly felt the pressure to keep up with that.” I asked Laurence “Loz” Colbert, drummer of the 1990s band Ride, who reunited in 2015, how he’d compare interactions with their fans then and now. “People want more of you now, every day,” he told me, “and it means less because what you used to do with so few people now you do with so many.”</p>
      <p>For some, like Keating, meeting these new relational expectations comes easily. Musicians often feel close to their audiences anyway. They feel an intimate connection when they play, or when fans tell their personal stories. They get to know their audiences as groups and individuals, sometimes becoming friends, lovers, and family. Some, like Billy Bragg, who’s had a loyal community of fans for decades, may see their audience as friends with whom they’re growing old. The Cure’s Roger O’Donnell gets emails every day. “I don’t like to call them fans,” he says, “not anymore. They’re more like friends, people that are interested in my music and what I’m doing. I get three or four a day, and I’ll answer, and I have good conversations with people.”</p>
      <p>The more relationships with audiences resemble friendship, the more relational labor may be demanded, both to craft relationships with audiences that feel close and to differentiate those relationships from more personal ones. What does it mean when you disclose the same things to <a data-locator="p175" class="page"></a>friends as you share with crowds of semi-anonymous online followers? Is that really what they want? Nacho Vegas looks back with nostalgia on earlier times. “It’s much easier now to be in contact with your audience,” he says in imperfect yet perfect English, “but it’s too much easier.” Musicians are navigating what one called “uncharted waters, where everything is on display.” Rituals and routines like those we saw at concerts and merchandise tables can no longer be relied on to guide interaction. Without recording technology, the press, or venue architectures to bound how much and in what ways they interact with audiences, it is up to each person to find a tolerable balance between being interactive and being autonomous, being open and showing restraint. And each person must keep finding that balance, interaction by interaction, day after day, on platform after platform. Managing this can be more challenging than <a id="p176" class="page"></a>a big family holiday. “Unlike pretending to be fond of your Uncle Larry at Thanksgiving dinner,” advises Scott Kirsner, “this relationship with your audience cannot be faked.”<a id="en410r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en410">8</a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>Friends and family are appealing models, especially if one is trying to manage the dialectic tension between music as communication and music as commodity. Recasting a relationship from economic into friends or family emphasizes its social, moral value. But for the most part, musicians and their audiences are neither friends nor family. The metaphors only stretch so far before beginning to fray. Aristotle distinguished true friendship, which is its own reward, from utilitarian friendship, which exists to serve other ends. True friendship is voluntary, equal, and laden with emotional, communicative, tangible, and behavioral expectations, not least of which is that friends disclose personal information with one another.<a id="en411r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en411">9</a></p>
      <p>Musicians may find some of these qualities of true friendship with their audiences as a whole, and may find all of it with specific individuals who are also audience members, but they cannot find all of it with all of their audience. No one can have that many true friends. Furthermore, relationships between musicians and audiences are inherently utilitarian for musicians, if not for audiences, creating a potentially problematic asymmetry. No matter how sincerely they feel a sense of true friendship, musicians’ careers depend on their audiences’ feelings toward them. Relationships formed through instrumental and economic origins can still have personal dimensions. Workers in all kinds of contexts, especially care work, “get to know each other as role occupants and sometimes as acquaintances or even friends,” developing a shared interaction history over time.<a id="en412r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en412">10</a> But the power dynamics and relational expectations in these relationships differ from friendships in important ways.</p>
      <p>Important as it is to create a sense of authenticity and closeness for audiences, it is equally essential to draw lines audiences are not allowed to cross. This relational labor of boundary-setting takes strategy and skill. What separates one kind of relationship from another is not given, but negotiated and subject to change. Viviana Zelizer describes people as implicitly consulting “a grid of relationships arranged by their similarity or dissimilarity and mark[ing] boundaries between adjacent relations.” The behaviors and interactions that define a relationship as being on <a id="p177" class="page"></a>one side of a boundary or another are rarely “universally acceptable or unacceptable in themselves; they depend on context.” As a result, we can never get out of the work of “marking the boundaries between the relations at hand and others with which they might easily and banefully be confused,” especially, Zelizer argues, when those relationships entail economic transactions.<a id="en413r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en413">11</a></p>
      <p>Offering audiences intimate glimpses of everyday, mundane life may help musicians flourish. Keating attributes her income in part to her openness. It can also be personally enriching. When we present ourselves as we believe ourselves to be to others and those others validate us, they provide the kind of intimate recognition that helps us become the selves we strive to be.<a id="en414r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en414">12</a> Presenting a more accessible, private self to audiences can strengthen our sense of who we are and why we matter. Roger O’Donnell likes “the idea of writing a song in the afternoon and letting people hear it that day; and letting them know what the process is, letting them know what you do in your studio, how it works, how you write music. But I know a lot of people aren’t comfortable with that, and like to maintain the mystique.” “We’re removing some of the mystique of all that used to be,” said Stephen Mason, “the music and the engagement with fans has not suffered, it has only gotten better, it has only improved, it’s only made the experience on our end as the artist more enjoyable. And I have to say, as a music fan too, who follows a lot of bands on Twitter, and Facebook, it’s enhanced my experience of a lot of bands that I love as well.” The late Swedish pop genius Gustaf Kjellvander of the Fine Arts Showcase, agreed. “It’s important to remember that people who play music are just people,” he said. “The internet helps that, it’s not this huge iconic book of characters, rock stars. Personally I think the rock star thing is boring and played out.”</p>
      <h2 id="ah0602" class="ah">The Perils of Closeness</h2>
      <p class="paft">Equalizing as it can be, the degree of personal engagement now called for can also threaten musicians’ selves and music. It might seem easier to be real when that means expressing your innermost self than when it means meeting immutable external criteria. After all, people in Western cultures generally experience themselves and others as having an authentic core whether they display it to others or not. But selves, like relationships, are <a id="p178" class="page"></a>dialogic, revolving not “around such a unitary essence of self,” so much as “countervailing equally valid versions of one another.”<a id="en415r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en415">13</a> Musicians, like us all, play different roles in different situations, each of which may be as real as the next. How we are treated in those roles and situations then feeds back into who we become. People become “real” in relation with one another. Authentic selves never preexist.</p>
      <p>The new demands of intimacy can be too much: too commercial, too much time, too much interaction, too much expectation, too much vulnerability, too much risk. In a broader cultural environment where authenticity has been co-opted by brand culture and “artisanal” goods are mass manufactured, artists who simply present themselves as wanting to engage their audience can be viewed cynically as marketing themselves, and thus undermine their own or others’ perceptions of their artistic integrity. When, as Sarah Banet-Weiser describes it, “building a brand is about building an affective, authentic relationship with a consumer, one based—just like a <i>relationship</i> between two people—on the accumulation of memories, emotions, personal narratives, and expectations,” it can be hard to tell the difference between a genuine effort to make human connection and an ad campaign.<a id="en416r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en416">14</a></p>
      <p>When you have to be authentic to be a real artist and also to market yourself, you’re walking a fine line. Remember (in chapter 4) Happy Tom’s admonition not to confuse having a community with having a sales channel? Musicians often struggle with the paradox between being themselves and selling themselves. Like self-branding more generally, the expectations musicians face are contradictory, promoting “both ‘authenticity’ and business-targeted self-presentation.”<a id="en417r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en417">15</a> As Marwick describes it, the resulting incongruity is a source of stress and emotional labor for practitioners in many fields.</p>
      <p>On this matter, though, music audiences are often generous. They recognize that artists work in systems they cannot control. Like Springsteen’s fans, they can see a musician as a “human being who has had to deal with commodity-producing institutions like the music business and the media and has had to work through the consequences of having his work mass-produced” without viewing them as tools of that system.<a id="en418r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en418">16</a> An understanding audience can help an artist maintain a sense of both authenticity and integrity, while acknowledging and accepting that intimacy may have some utilitarian aims.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0601" class="bh"><a id="p179" class="page"></a>The Last Shards of Mystique</h3>
      <p class="paft">Many musicians, and some fans, worry that knowing too much about the people who make music can detract from audiences’ experiences. Noel Gallagher from Oasis complained in 2006 that “all the fantasy’s gone out of music, ’cos everything is too fucking real.”<a id="en419r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en419">17</a> He explained that he was brought up on icons of mystique, Marc Bolan and David Bowie, “and it was like, ‘Do they actually come from fucking Mars?’” The scene in Bowie’s movie <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> where he eats a bowl of metal seems like a better fit for his musical personas than any breakfast the real man might ever have tweeted.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when you show audiences who you really are, that’s just not who they want you to be. That can undermine a career. It can also undermine a self. No matter how “real” musicians try to be, audiences are still likely to project fantasies on to them. Wendy Fonarow describes musicians as tricksters. Though they are “really just an ordinary person with a few tricks up his sleeve, a bass slung at her waist or a pair of sticks in his hand,”<a id="en420r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en420">18</a> they can temporarily make the audience think that their sensory and emotional experience is real, that they are wizards, not salespeople. Blues musicians are often seen as “mournful saints and unabashed sinners, wise sages and innocent fools” who sell their souls to the devil and are nomadic sexual conquerors. This works well for legend, but “can sometimes prevent us from understanding these performers as real human beings.”<a id="en421r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en421">19</a></p>
      <p>Musicians know that audiences will hold them accountable both for the “illusion of verisimilitude” they create and for whatever the audience imagines them to be.<a id="en422r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en422">20</a> “When a fan or audience member sees a performer as himself or herself rather than as the character he or she envisioned,” Fonarow writes, “it is difficult to go back to believing in the character. When you see how the trick is performed, you can’t believe in the trick anymore.”<a id="en423r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en423">21</a> “It’s a tricky one,” explained Mark Kelly,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">because at the end of the day you’ve got these fans that are into your music and it’s almost like you know the musician isn’t the music. You’ve got the message and the messenger, and maybe they should be kept a bit separate because if they find out too much about it, it might interfere with their enjoyment of the music that they listen to. People say they want to <a id="p180" class="page"></a>know everything that’s going on, but again, when we’re in the studio writing and recording, if I was to tweet everything that happened, you know, the things that people say, the arguments that we have, the stuff that goes down, it would probably destroy the magic a little bit, you know?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">“I have met some of my heroes,” warned Lloyd Cole, “and it’s not always a good thing. And I do think that that inequality in the relationship is what keeps it alive. And I think one of the things that’s possible with my web presence is that the last shards of my mystique are in danger of being completely obliterated.”</p>
      <p>A star is usually seen as “an extraordinary fellow who brings excitement and glamour into the lives of his fans, ordinary people,” argued Simon Frith, “but the process works the other way around too: stars, dull professionals, are made glamorous by the imagination and wit and excitement of their fans.”<a id="en424r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en424">22</a> Cole is right to see that filling gaps in fans’ imaginations with details of his everyday life could interfere with their ability to experience the music on its own terms. “I don’t necessarily want to know what Tina Turner ate for breakfast,” one musician told me, speaking as a fan. “I think that artists should maintain a certain distance.”</p>
      <p>Mystique, with all of the awe and power it implies, has its virtues. D. A. Wallach argues that to preserve mystique and keep consistent with their image, some musicians should not use social media themselves. “I was on a panel last week about this stuff,” he told me. “I said look if you’re Jack Johnson and your kind of brand is that everyone likes you because you feel like the guy next door, then it’s consistent and on message for you to be very responsive yourself and to be Twittering all of the time. But if you’re Ozzy Osbourne you can still engage the medium, but maybe it should be your roadie tweeting about all of the blow that you’re doing.”</p>
      <p>Musicians don’t need to actively craft mystique to leave false impressions that can diminish audience affections when absences are replaced with details. Letting audiences see who they “really” are can lead people who like them or their music to change their minds. Sometimes artists cross a line they didn’t see coming. Fans burned Beatles records when John Lennon described the band as “bigger than Jesus.” Other times, they violate the expectations of the social positions fans expect someone<a id="p181" class="page"></a> in their genre to hold. Audiences turned against country band the Dixie Chicks when they spoke out against then-President George W. Bush. Fans were mortified when hip-hop’s Kanye West declared that he didn’t vote, but would have voted for Donald Trump if he had. Many seemed to prefer to interpret it as a sign of mental illness, which is at least in keeping with West’s image, than as a sign of real politics that betray who they want West to be. It may also be that the musician a fan loves has personal flaws severe enough to cause audiences to turn. Azealia Banks has managed to get herself banned from both Twitter, for going on a racist tirade against Zayn Malik, and Facebook, for going on a tirade against everyone in Brazil. When I asked people on Twitter if anyone had ever liked a musician less because of how they acted on social media, one response complained about a person with “the ability to both be sincere and incredibly obnoxious,” and whose efforts at being vocal about what he believes come across as “petty narcissistic complaints” that reveal his lack of originality. Letting your authentic self out may drive fans away.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0602" class="bh">Too Much Intimacy</h3>
      <p class="paft">Getting close can also become harmful in a variety of personal ways. The never-ending invitation to interact with your audience may become a habit that distracts you from what your better self would have you do. Not long after she’d run a successful innovative early fan-funding campaign, Jill Sobule found herself online all the time engaging with her audience. She also had a terrible case of writer’s block. A friend encouraged her to see a psychiatrist, “because I’m thinking maybe I have ADD, maybe I should get on Ritalin. I was that desperate.” The doctor asked her to talk through a typical day. When he took out a pad to write a prescription, Sobule thought, “I’m getting speed.” She wasn’t. The prescription read, “no internet for two weeks.” She made it eight days. It was “fantastic.” Coming up with ways to stay away can be critical for those who do relational labor, especially for people who like it.</p>
      <p>If you have a lot of fans, the sheer scale of people who want you to engage can also threaten the self, making it hard to sustain the sense of closeness they may seek and you may wish you could provide. Casey Rain explained that Swami’s female singer couldn’t turn on Facebook’s <a id="p182" class="page"></a>chat feature because too many random people immediately expected her to chat with them. Travers complained that when he got on Facebook, people kept sending him the stickers that were popular on the site at the time and asking why he hadn’t reciprocated. It might have made sense with five fans, or with friends, but with “11,000 people signing on, I thought ‘no, this is crazy.’”</p>
      <p>The threat of too many fans is complemented by the threat of individual fans who want too much. Fans may come to feel entitled and indignant if the artist doesn’t respond. They may persistently and repeatedly ask the musician to play on their own record. They may ask them to send birthday cards to their friends. If an artist has met a fan once or twice, the fan’s sense of entitlement can be particularly intense. Put them on a guest list, they may take for granted that they will always get in free and have backstage access. “People have unrealistic expectations about what you’re going to do for them or what your relationship is to them and they don’t know the boundaries,” Jon Ginoli sighed.</p>
      <p>Fans can also become too adoring. Though he warns us not to be trite in connecting music fandom to religion, Daniel Cavicchi notes that both are “centered around actions of devotion which may create similarities of experience.”<a id="en425r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en425">23</a> When music can be a religious experience, it’s not a huge stretch to assign God status to the music makers. “I’m not really like the top-of-the-charts level where there are millions and millions of people obsessed,” explains Kristin Hersh, “but there are occasionally a few kids who seem very lost, a lot of times come from broken homes, and are really, really looking to find—you know, they really connect with the music, and they think that I’m like their saving grace kind of thing.” This sort of adulation, even in its lighter-weight varieties, can feel like a powerful corrupter for musicians who value authenticity and accessibility.<a id="en426r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en426">24</a> When the adoration can manifest through everyday media in addition to infrequent in-person encounters, it can also just be a drag.</p>
      <p>For a small but problematic handful of fans, obsession with the music leads to obsession with the artist, and a sense that the relationship is or should be mutual. Stephen Mason referred to this as “false intimacy” (so too did an Instagram celebrity interviewed by Crystal Abidin).<a id="en427r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en427">25</a> Nearly everyone I spoke with raised this topic. Recording may have separated musicians from fans in space, but, as we have seen, the ability to listen <a id="p183" class="page"></a>on repeat, in high fidelity, in private spaces, and alone made the sense of intimate connection between fan and performer more palpable.<a id="en428r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en428">26</a></p>
      <p>I’ve probably spent years of my life with the sounds of others’ voices and instruments quite literally dwelling inside me, often delivered directly into my body through headphones or earbuds. To pick a favorite example, I’ve been listening to Sivert Høyem sing for the last decade. He’s evoked every emotion I know and many I can’t name. I’ve felt in love. I’ve felt compassion. I’ve felt pain, rage, righteous indignation, arousal, melancholy, yearning, sadness, and grief through the textures of his voice. I’ve had a few moments of being glad I learned the difference between singer and song decades ago, especially as I prepared to interview him for this book. It’s not hard to imagine how someone standing on shakier emotional ground to begin with could project all of that onto him.</p>
      <p>And they do. I asked Høyem if he’d had interactions with audience members that were upsetting or really bothered him. “Yeah,” he answered, “some people pick up on everything I do, and they seem to think that it’s all very significant, so they just seem to get a little too much. There’s been quite a few who have been a little scary.”</p>
      <p>The problem is amplified by technology and his internal standards of politeness. “Sometimes, since you’re really available to people all the time—if people want to get a hold of me, they can—so some people—you just start communicating with people and they just kind of—it can take up a little bit too much of your time, because they write back all the time, and I don’t want to be rude, so.”</p>
      <p>“So you feel kind of compelled to keep responding?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, and it can get a little too friendly.”</p>
      <p>I wonder aloud if this is because his voice can feel so intimate living in our bodies as it does.</p>
      <p>“Well, I guess some people have really—they have that kind of connection on a really spiritual level or whatever, and they really feel that they know me. That can be pretty scary. For a small country like Norway, that’s just not okay.” He laughs uncomfortably.</p>
      <p>I ask if he’s felt physically unsafe.</p>
      <p>“No, no, no. It’s just that nowadays, it’s easy for people to monopolize you if they want to. And I have people just sending me ten emails each <a id="p184" class="page"></a>day and contacting me and following me on everything I do, sending me text messages and stuff, which is just really tiring and annoying.”</p>
      <p>It’s taken decades to convince the world at large that even if “fan” comes from “fanatic,” fandom is not a pathology. The overwhelming majority of music lovers, even if they feel close to musicians, never contact them at all. If they do, they behave entirely appropriately. But the fans who demand musicians’ attention are not those who never communicate, or who do so quickly, politely, and then disappear. Social media technologies may create physical distance that leaves musicians’ bodies safe from obsessive fans, but the presence of social media in daily life makes obsessive behavior so visible and invasive that it can make them more psychologically vulnerable. “In the past, there was a kind of—I suppose a kind of barrier between you and the public,” said Travers, an avid tweeter. “I think Twitter has changed a few things, and Facebook’s changed a few things. You can kind of be subject to some kind of crazy people and that could get to you.” It only takes a few people who push the boundaries too far to call for developing strategies for managing distance.</p>
      <p>Many of the people I spoke with, male and female, had dealt with some degree of stalking. Sydney Wayser recounted a tale of someone who followed her around Europe, telling different stories about where he lived wherever he was. “It’s unsettling,” she concluded, “because you want to be nice to your fans, you want to welcome them into your camp kind of, but what is that boundary, I don’t really know.” Another, who is English speaking, has a German stalker. “I got two emails from her today. She usually writes to me in German, and I usually can’t be bothered to translate them.” The day we spoke she had written in English to ask if he thinks she is hot. I ask how long this has been going on. Five years, he says. And she’s not his only stalker. She writes in spates: “it’s like once a month, and within the space of a few hours. The first one will start, ‘Oh we’re supposed to be together. I love you. Why won’t you—we should try and make this work.’ But by the tenth email she’s like, ‘I fucking hate you. You’re a piece of shit. You’re an ugly old man.’ She talks herself out of it.”</p>
      <p>“I sort of have a stalker,” another man told me. “This dude that like he used to make me all of these mix CDs and stuff. And then it just got out of control and he kept sending me more and more emails and everything.<a id="p185" class="page"></a> And I just sort of turned that stuff off. And then you get the email that says like ‘oh I hope I didn’t piss you off’ and it’s a really long email apologizing. And then the next email will be angry. You just see all of these different things. I just tend to try to ignore that.”</p>
      <p>With false intimacy an ever-present possibility, even relatively benign messages from fans, like a message on Twitter saying “I was on a train with you today!” or a Facebook post that says “I saw you in the station last night and I wanted to tell you how much I love your music but I didn’t because you were making out with someone” can make people uncomfortable. “It does sort of have its sort of overtones of stalking doesn’t it?” Mark Kelly reflects, “but of course it’s not. It’s just people going about their daily business that see you. And not everybody is the sort of person that would come up to you and go ‘Hey, are you Mark Kelly?’”</p>
      <p>Nearly every musician I spoke with had fans who communicate too frequently or with too much depth, revealing things musicians don’t want to see or know. Several had been sent naked photographs. This can feel invasive enough when you don’t want unsolicited nudes. Romantic partners may take offense that you’ve seen them, even if you didn’t want them. When the fans who send photographs are under age eighteen, simply receiving them is a violation of international law. Musicians also hear frightening disclosures. “Occasionally you get people who just won’t stop writing you and it turns into crazy shit,” said D. A. Wallach, “You end up hearing about their abusive father.” Greta Morgan, who you will remember found it deeply validating that her music comforted grieving parents (see chapter 1), has also found herself thrust into the middle of other family dynamics that were far harder to address:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">I’ve had a few disturbing interactions where—for example, one girl who would come to our shows all the time—her father would start sending me emails about how he couldn’t go to the show because he had to spend a night in jail and their mom—and, you know, like all these personal stories. Then I would get another message from this girl, who’s a fan, saying “I’m so sorry. Ignore my dad. He’s manic-depressive and he’s in a bad bout.” That kind of thing. Like when a family really, really reaches out to me and I see some of their kind of emotional or personality flaws in that way, like in a very obsessive, scary kind of way, it freaks me out a little bit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p186" class="page"></a>Few of us are prepared for encounters like this. Musicians are no different. They just have to deal with it more often, thanks, in no small part, to social media.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0603" class="ah">Distancing</h2>
      <p class="paft">In short, even those who like close relationships and want to welcome fans into their camp find they need strategies to set boundaries and create distance. The musicians I interviewed used a variety of bounding strategies. They may explicitly set themselves apart, like Cole:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">It’s possible that you get people who are somewhat delusional about their relationship with the artist, and I don’t think it’s to be encouraged. I still make it quite clear, and I try to reiterate it throughout my presence on my website, that I am the artist and I am onstage, and you’re not onstage, and the concert is the concert. And we have a community, and I really appreciate it, but we’re not a band together. You’re my community, and obviously I appreciate the fact that you keep me in business, so to speak, but our relationship is not like a normal friendship.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Like Sobule, whose therapist told her not to use the internet for two weeks, musicians must also learn strategies for managing when they will be accessible to their audiences. In Sobule’s case, she learned that she can take a vacation from social media now and then and her audience will still be there when she returns. In the meantime, she can write songs. Kristen Hersh combats the “noisiness” of social media by choosing silence when she doesn’t feel like engaging. Deepchild blocks out time to do social media daily. Wallach does it on the tour bus. Wayser tweets when she’s on tour, but not when she’s writing. Nacho Vegas and Johan Angergård take their time joining sites, making sure they are interested and will be willing to keep using them before creating profiles.</p>
      <p>Musicians also develop strategies for managing how much they respond to their audiences when they are online. Some stick to platforms that let them stay brief. Høyem has finally found a way of using the internet that suits him. When he’s on tour or has a new album to promote, he checks Facebook almost daily, answering most of the questions he’s asked, and responding to or “liking” many of the comments people leave <a id="p187" class="page"></a>on his posts. “With Facebook, it just seems very easy. And people don’t expect to get a long message whenever they just write, ‘Hey, when are you coming to Cologne?’ or ‘When are you coming to Mexico City?’ It’s easy for me to just reply with just a sentence or something. It’s really superficial. But it’s nice, I guess, for people to know that I’m there checking.”</p>
      <p>Wallach’s strategy, motivated less by self-preservation than by his ideas about professionalism, is to be intentionally coy:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">You want to create an exciting experience of being a fan for your audience. And that involves both presenting and concealing information in interesting and surprising ways that make it fun to follow you, fun to wonder what you’re up to or whatever. . . . I think there is a virtue on the customer service side of things, if it were a traditional business, in answering every single question on Twitter. But I think as an entertainer there might be kind of a value to answering one out of every ten so that it feels really special if you do, and you’re kind of reinforcing some sense of inaccessibility or stardom.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Wallach does respond to fans’ emails but has developed a radar for detecting situations like the one where a fan started telling him about her abusive father. His antenna goes up when he sees “trigger phrases like ‘I really believe that we need to meet each other,’” or anything that makes him think “under no circumstance would I ever write that email to someone even if I love what they do.” When that happens, he doesn’t reply, even if he had been interacting with that person before.</p>
      <p>One person I spoke with had some “bad experiences in the early days” and developed a simple “policy.” She will let people know that she appreciates the story they sent, that she’s glad they enjoyed the concert and hopes to see them again, or that she really is coming to Denver in October, but “I don’t email someone twice. I just don’t respond to the second email. I don’t want to have an email conversation one-on-one with fans.” She connects this to a general unwillingness to get close to fans that began when she got burned by dating one too many.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">I would hook up with someone and then they would tell all their friends and then they would tell all their friends. I have very very low tolerance <a id="p188" class="page"></a>for that. It only had to happen a few times for me to be just like “Ok. Done. Done.” I don’t need to find a date at my gig. I think some of that went into online boundaries. For me, rather than try to go case-by-case, I just made a decision like “You know what? There’s a certain kind of communication that is cool with me in terms of me as a musician you as a fan, and there’s a certain kind that isn’t.” I do draw a pretty strong line between how I communicate with fans and how I communicate with friends.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Travers shuts conversations down with laughter when fans “want to know about your life and things” or “crazy, crazy personal stuff.” He figures if he laughs, he’s “like a dog wagging his tail. Nobody kicks a dog wagging his tail. They kind of laugh with you and move on. You don’t have to point out that they’re being a bit too close.”</p>
      <p>Finally, musicians manage closeness by carefully selecting the topics they discuss. Relationship scholars have long connected self-disclosure to intimacy, arguing that as people become closer, they cover more topics and do so in greater depth. While this is sometimes presumed to lead to liking a person, it doesn’t always. Good relationships “are established as much by privacy, secrecy, and deception as by self-disclosure, empathy, and openness.”<a id="en429r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en429">27</a> Being available and open may be a good strategy sometimes for some people, but “it may be equally important for individuals to develop skill at restrained remarks and selective disclosure.”<a id="en430r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en430">28</a></p>
      <p>We all live in streams of experience, any moment of which could be converted into self-expression. Which moments should be shared with audiences? The social norms guiding “appropriate” disclosure are unclear. How much information is too much information? In friendship and other interpersonal relationships, “appropriate” disclosure is that which is reciprocated, part of an ongoing relationship that builds in small steps, “takes the receiver’s feelings and responses into account,” “is relevant to the current topic of discussion,” and “is intended to improve the relationship.”<a id="en431r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en431">29</a> These terms rarely apply to interactions between musicians and audiences, leaving few benchmarks for how to assess what is and is not okay to share. Even in interpersonal relationships, “high levels of disclosure often turn out to be a mixed blessing at best and a deterrent to attraction at worst.” Rawlins describes the tension between being open and honest and being closed and protective as one of the <a id="p189" class="page"></a>most important dialectics in close friendships.<a id="en432r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en432">30</a> Like everyone else who uses social media, musicians “must maintain equilibrium between a contextual social norm of personal authenticity that encourages information-sharing and phatic communication (the oft-cited ‘what I had for breakfast’ example) with the need to keep information private, or at least concealed from certain audiences.”<a id="en433r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en433">31</a></p>
      <p>Information management skills become particularly salient when people’s families are involved. It is one thing to put yourself out there for critical evaluation and another to do the same with loved ones. Again, people simply have different tolerances of vulnerability. Stephen Mason has shared photographs of his daughter from when she was a baby bump well into middle childhood. Keating shares her family life with her audience, from her young family’s joyous years with their brand-new son through the horror of her husband’s illness, cancer diagnosis, death, and into her grief, single parenting, and finding new footing. She may make no divisions between her private and professional selves, but she does make them for her extended family. “If it’s Christmas and I’m with my family members at Christmas I won’t tweet. I won’t talk about other family members. Unless I ask them, like say, ‘hey can I post this?’ I’ll ask them. So I make a division there because it’s not just me, it’s somebody else. I don’t want to impact somebody else’s life.”</p>
      <p>Others make strict rules against mentioning family, often in consultation with them. For as long as he can remember, Lowery has deleted any discussion of his children on his web page. Their mother was “more paranoid about people getting fixated on our kids, or knowing who our kids were, or anything like that. And I think that she was actually pretty smart for establishing that early on.” Cole’s wife is also “hypersensitive” to his sharing personal information:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">I try and keep my wife and children pretty much completely out of it. I might mention the odd thing, like I’ve got a little band with my children now for fun, playing AC/DC songs and things. But my father recently uploaded a video of it from our basement, which one of the fans got hold of and put it on the forum, and my wife and I don’t want my kids really to be recognizable with my work. So we asked that to be taken down, and I made a point of saying, “This is something that shouldn’t happen again.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a id="p190" class="page"></a>People may keep families out of bounds in their own discussions even when families make themselves public. Høyem never mentions his wife or children on social media, although his wife wrote a book about her postpartum depression. He referred to it in song, but online he’s “trying not to just Twitter and blog and stuff about things that don’t have anything to do with what I’m supposed to be doing, which is the music.”</p>
      <p>Part of what makes an interpersonal relationship intimate is that there are some things you only talk about with each other.<a id="en434r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en434">32</a> Sharing information with online audiences can thus threaten the intimacy of close relationships. Kelly, for instance, got in trouble with his wife for “posting stuff that’s too personal.” He didn’t want to have a “corporate” approach where all he did was send out information about the band. He was finding it fun and “just tweeting whatever was going on.” But he got “a bit risky with it.” The TMI his wife couldn’t abide? “Tweeting that I had a vasectomy.” He’s not sure whether his audience would have found it interesting. He “must admit I haven’t done so much lately. Maybe I’ve gone a bit—gone too far with it now.” What feels appropriate changes as the people around you respond to your public presence.</p>
      <p>Another way to manage information strategically is to talk openly, but only about topics that are neither deeply personal nor out of keeping with your image. If a musician’s image is tied to a topic other than themselves already, like Billy Bragg’s is tied to politics, they can avoid personal self-disclosure by talking about things they are known to care about without having to reveal much about themselves that audiences don’t already know. Bragg debates politics on his fan sites with relative impunity:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">If you look back on my Facebook page you see me there, not just posting stuff but arguing with people about it as well, and learning stuff from them, and putting ideas out and forming ideas. It helps me too, you know, we’re going to have a referendum next year. . . . By the time we get to the referendum I’m going to have so many arguments on Facebook with people I’ll be sharp as a pin. I will have seen it from every which way and hopefully I’ll be able to sum it down into 140 words and I’ll be able to put it on Twitter.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sobule likens her fan pages to an eighteenth-century salon of which she is the madame, throwing out topics in hopes of getting fans to talk to one another rather than to her. She might post to ask them what they’re <a id="p191" class="page"></a>thinking. She is happiest when her online presence is “not about me. It’s just for a community of people to talk to each other, like-minded people. So I’m the madame of my house.” Sometimes she will ask innocuous questions like “has anyone got a good dentist in New York?” But, knowing that her audience knows she’s “a news junkie,” she will also try to get them talking about politics. For instance, she might intentionally rile up her “really rightwing fans” by posting something provocative about the Swedish healthcare system, launching comment threads that go on and on whether she posts to them or not. Other musicians do the same, but with sports.</p>
      <p>The ultimate way to create distance when things get too vulnerable is to quit the medium. One musician I met after a concert recently told me he’s quit social media entirely because “no matter what you say, people attack you for it.” There were several high-profile cases of celebrities walking away from social media platforms in 2016. Justin Bieber, upset at the comments fans were leaving on pictures he posted with his girlfriend to Instagram, left the site. The actress Leslie Jones quit Twitter when she was the target of a coordinated campaign of racist misogyny. Even the Queen of Social Media, Kim Kardashian, quit for a time after she was bound at gunpoint by robbers who took much of the expensive jewelry she had so often made a point of wearing in her selfies. To leave social media, though, is to forego the opportunities you may have to monetize your presence there. Kardashian regained some privacy, and I hope a greater sense of safety, but she lost millions. Few have millions, or even singles, to lose. Musicians who need to reach their fans to fund their careers may feel they don’t have that choice to walk away.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0604" class="ah">Dynamic Limits</h2>
      <p class="paft">The ideology of intimacy would have us all believe that behaviors we once kept for loved ones translate seamlessly to interactions with the public. The ideology promotes “communication which is not dependent on public roles and institutions,” without recognizing that “expenditures of time and energy increase dramatically when communication becomes independent of the norms, stereotypes, formalities, and rituals which characterize public roles and institutions.” Musicians are at the leading edge of workers caught expending time and energy working out norms for everyday intimacies with audiences that are untethered from <a id="p192" class="page"></a>the public norms and rituals that previously guided those relationships. When we expect all of our relationships to look like personal ones, with authentic, natural feeling mobilized as a resource within them, we may be asking “more of relationships than they can give, thereby fostering dissatisfaction and alienation.”<a id="en435r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en435">33</a></p>
      <p>Even if it weren’t the case that publics are filled with anti-fans and antagonists, the kinds of openness and accessibility that fans increasingly expect from musicians can be threatening. Certainly, musicians who open themselves can find validation and meaningful relationships. But they may also find attacks, disillusionment, conflict in their own families, a sense of being overwhelmed, and feelings of discomfort and unease. Not everyone wants intimacy, even in relationships with people they know well. There’s no inherent reason to think that musicians who open themselves to more intimate personal relationships with fans will be any happier than those who don’t. Given all the issues accessibility and openness can raise, they may be less happy. When causal links between communicating like a friend and making money are so unclear, for some it may simply not be worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Artists are almost always urged to learn to get closer to audiences, but what they really need to learn is how to get close enough while staying distant enough to preserve their sense of integrity, of private self, of personal relationships that are different from fan relationships, and of the audience’s experience of the music itself, which can be spoiled by too much information about those who make it. To protect themselves and those who love them, musicians develop strategies that help them balance their needs and desires to be open and connected with their needs to preserve their privacy and be autonomous. There is not an all-purpose, correct solution, only correct solutions for individuals in specific moments. What works for them in one interaction may not work in another. They also need to differentiate their own sense of self from that of the musician their audience knows. Especially when the cell phone makes everyplace a workplace, musicians need to know how to “detach and differentiate aspects of themselves from workplace environments.”<a id="en436r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en436">34</a> When online workplace environments are filled with not only people you want to reach but also those who hate you and those who love you too much, the need to find a self you can be both at home or at work or a way to keep identities distinct across contexts becomes ever more important.</p>
