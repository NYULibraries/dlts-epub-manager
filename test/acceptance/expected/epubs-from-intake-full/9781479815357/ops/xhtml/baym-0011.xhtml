      <h1 class="ct">Music as Communication</h1>
      <p class="pf">If you’ve ever seen Kristin Hersh perform, you know that music is her calling. She seems to enter an almost altered state. Her head moves like an owl’s. She shrieks and screams. Her guitar emits an enormous amount of sound. It’s beautiful, but it can be a little scary. As soon as Throwing Muses started, she realized “that music happened between people.” “We weren’t entertainers,” she told me, “because we weren’t entertaining. But there was something that was happening when we made noise and a room full of people got it. It was resonating with them, which resonated with us. We felt like at our deepest, we were the same, as lame as that sounds. Musically it seems to be almost physically true. It was quite clear to us that we needed these people in order to make music happen. And music was our religion for lack of a better word.”</p>
      <p>Music is a way of communicating that somehow, by evoking without referring, has extraordinary power to help people find their deepest selves, bring them together, and feel connected to what feels most important. Hersh describes a cycle in which people make music that resonates as sound waves, listeners feel those energetic waves and send them back, inflected with their own energies. When it works, music has unique powers to help people connect to themselves, to their deities, and to one another.</p>
      <p>Music has always been about building, sustaining, and reworking social relationships and institutions. No matter how commercialized it becomes, it can “never be just a product.”<a id="en94r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en94">1</a> In a history that manages to undersell its breadth even with the title <i>A Million Years of Music: The Emergence of Human Modernity</i>, Gary Tomlinson synthesizes evidence from fields as diverse as musicology, paleontology, cognition, philosophy of mind, and semiotics to show how music, technology, and human sociality emerged together in our species, stimulated by cognitive and sociotechnical skills developed over time spans far longer than human existence. Music emerged among our prehistoric ancestors as they <a id="p32" class="page"></a>worked together, co-present in ancient “taskscapes.” Over hundreds of thousands of years in one another’s presence, they developed some of the basic prerequisites for music: synchronized rhythms (or “entrainment”) and cognitive capacities such as abstraction, the ability to think of things in the future or things that are not present, and the ability to combine physical and conceptual parts into hierarchical, forward-thinking combinations.<a id="en95r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en95">2</a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sometime in this ancient story, our predecessors developed vocal “gesture calls.” These cries, grunts, growls, whimpers, howls, and who knows what other sounds had social functions, conveying information that helped co-present beings navigate encounters in which they needed to know whether to approach or avoid, submit or dominate, and otherwise establish social order quickly and effectively. As they shared and coordinated their activities, our ancestors developed shared cognitive patterns of expectation, violation, and fulfillment tied to sociality and sound, patterns that music continues to exploit for emotional effect.<a id="p33" class="page"></a> Slowly, gesture calls were refined, conveying ever subtler shades of meaning. Early humans gained control of their vocal chords.</p>
      <p>Eventually, human gesture cries split. One branch became language, used to create shared meaning through the manipulation of symbols. The other, often now called “paralinguistics,” continues to directly express the primal affective and social information central to coordinating our encounters. Our speech retains this musicality. Even as our words convey information about content, the way we speak—our pitch, volume, rhythm, and pace—nonverbally encodes messages about how to interpret both content and relationship. Are the words meant to be exciting, sad, boring, sarcastic, or angry? Are they said as a friend, enemy, bureaucrat? Music exploits the affective and relational realms of gesture calls, arranging sounds aesthetically to provoke resonant cycles of meaning that other modes of communication cannot.</p>
      <p>The musicians I spoke with saw themselves as artists, creating work of aesthetic value, and, to varying degrees, as communicators, engaged in a form of social work. From its inception, music has been integral to the folk life of communities. For most of our existence, as Spanish singer-songwriter Nacho Vegas puts it while describing his own aspirations, people made music “while they were working or they were at funerals, or at parties. They made this music just for celebration of life, a way to communicate, one people to each other.” They didn’t want to “have a career or be a rock star or something like that.” Like most of us, musicians hope for a life not just of creature comforts but of significance. Stephen Mason, of Grammy-award-winning band Jars of Clay, mused that if the time came that they didn’t feel a “vibrant conversation between the audience and the music,” it might be time to break up. “If it was just down to the music itself,” he said, “I don’t know if we’d still be doing it, because we want what we do to have more significance than just a financial engagement: we make a product and people buy the product, and then we make money.”</p>
      <p>At the heart of this book is the question of how artists and audiences can relate to one another in ways that help them flourish within the decidedly modern context that calls on them to exploit their feelings and selves for commercial gain. Though some surely dream of stardom, people rarely become musicians because they think it’s a smart career move. To understand what helps them flourish, I start with the question <a id="p34" class="page"></a>of when the cycle of their communication with audiences feels most validating. Research suggests that people feel that their workplace is at its best when their individualism and uniqueness are recognized; they are challenged and achieve mastery; they feel belonging and connection, safety and security; and when they feel empowered, which includes having a voice, autonomy and flexibility, as well as being heard, needed, and able to help others.<a id="en96r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en96">3</a> I asked everyone I spoke with to give me an example of an interaction with their audience that they found “particularly rewarding.” Most of the stories in this chapter were told in response. These musicians echo the workers Lutgen-Sandvik and colleagues surveyed, especially regarding their ability to help others. These musicians appreciate how their music helps themselves and their audiences articulate and process feelings. They are humbled and rewarded by the relationships their music fosters, from seeing how it strengthens others’ bonds to forming new friendships of their own.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0101" class="ah">Seeking Meaning</h2>
      <p class="paft">Musicians need audiences. “I know I can play without anybody listening,” Hersh tells me, but “it’s unfinished then. It’s almost like a kid. You don’t want to keep it in the closet. You grow it up maybe, but then when it’s grown up it goes out and makes friends and is effective in the world. And you’re not done raising the kid until the world has accepted it.” Only listeners can do the essential work of “accepting their kid” by imbuing musicians’ work with meaning. Mikhail Bakhtin, pushing back against the idea that meaning resides in the mind, argued that whatever meaning an utterance may seem to have to its speaker, it only “reveals its depths” through engaging in “a kind of dialogue” with the meanings it encounters when real people hear and respond to it.<a id="en97r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en97">4</a> When an artwork is finished, as Martin Buber writes, it is “changed into It and frozen into a thing among things,” yet it is “still endowed with the meaning and the destiny to change back ever again” through the dialogic encounters with its audiences.<a id="en98r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en98">5</a> Art “enters into the world of things in order to remain incessantly effective, incessantly It—but also infinitely able to become again a You. Enchanting and inspiring.”<a id="en99r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en99">6</a></p>
      <p>Musicians are communicating in ways meant to produce feeling, but, like most culture workers, it is impossible to know in advance <a id="p35" class="page"></a>(and can be difficult to learn even afterward) whether and how their It became a You for audiences and with what consequences. The mass mediated music industries of the twentieth century separated and distanced musicians from their audiences in both time and space. Even though they could communicate to more people than ever before, they became less likely to interact with any of them. Recording artists have long had some clues as to how their music lands with their audiences. In a live performance, there is instantaneous feedback. Performers can tell whether resonance happens. They can see, hear, and feel their music encounter its audience. Recordings, however, “take on very different meanings” in people’s home.<a id="en100r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en100">7</a> Once recorded, music becomes “open to reinterpretation over and over again as listeners create new contexts for their reception and their ritual use of it.”<a id="en101r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en101">8</a> Audiences interpret music in many ways. They can be scholarly, synthesizing a diverse range of musical output, tracking themes through a body of work, or they can be personal, making aesthetic, political, and biographical associations.<a id="en102r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en102">9</a> In their interviews with creative workers in many fields, including music, David Hesmondhalgh and Sarah Baker found that “the often deeply affective and emotional nature of the response sought by creative workers in these distant, mediated audiences produces anxiety, ambivalence and even distrust.”<a id="en103r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en103">10</a> To resolve the uncertainty, musicians need to hear from audiences after their music has gone out into the world. Only through communication can they learn the significance of their work. Opening themselves to hear their audience’s experience can validate them as artists and as humans. But to become listeners they must be able to take criticism and withstand self-doubt.<a id="en104r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en104">11</a> What their audiences have to say may not always be what they want to hear.</p>
      <p>One of the first things people did once they networked computers and created communication media like email and bulletin board posts was discuss music (see chapter 3). This has made audience meanings more visible to musicians than ever before. David Bowie, interviewed in 2000, predicted that the twenty-first century would be about “the gray space in the middle”: “the idea that the piece of work is not finished until the audience comes to it and adds their new interpretation and what the piece of art is about is the gray space in the middle.”<a id="en105r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en105">12</a> The internet has made that gray space more visible. Brave musicians can read what people write about their work in online discussion forums and on social<a id="p36" class="page"></a> media. They can run search alerts, bringing anything that mentions them to their attention.</p>
      <figure id="fig0102" class="figure">

        <p class="figh"><a data-locator="p36" class="page"></a><span class="fighn">Figure 1.2.</span> Stuart Braithwaite, 2011. © Alessio Moffeis, and made available under a CC BY 2.0 license. https://www.flickr.com/photos/imaffo/6111455567.</p>
      </figure>
      <p>But musicians don’t have to look around to get feedback. Audiences now reach out to tell them on an unprecedented scale. “Our email address is on our website,” says Stuart Braithwaite of the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai, “so people can email us without any trouble. And we get a lot of really nice emails, a lot of contact that’s kind of just made me really happy about what we do and what our music means to people. People saying that our music means a lot to them and helps them. You know, just these kind of things.”</p>
      <p>“It’s just more immediate,” says Cowboy Junkies’ Michael Timmins; “the internet makes everything right there at people’s fingertips, and people feel they can reach out and it’ll reach you somehow.” The messages audiences send may speak to an artist’s work as a whole, to particular songs or moments in their lives, or what they loved about last night’s gig. “It’s a nice touch,” says Timmins. “It’s almost like a thank-you note. ‘I had a great time at the show last night.’ And, again, it does help. Especially when you’re on the road and you’re grinding it out and you <a id="p37" class="page"></a>get a few of those, and it’s like ‘Oh, wow, okay. So we did. We touched some people last night.’ That sort of stuff does help.”</p>
      <p>When I asked a younger artist, Sydney Wayser, if she ever thought about what it might have been like to be a musician before the internet, she responded initially with bemusement. “You mean I’d just make music?” Perhaps it would be nice to have more time to focus on music, she speculated. But then she remembered an email she received from a fan describing how one of her songs had opened long-blocked emotions and brought her release. If she were “so separated from the fans and from the listeners I would have never been able to know that I actually really affected someone like that,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>Timmins lurks on the Cowboy Junkies’ message board to see what people say about the music. “Yeah, I listen. I do pay attention.” He’s been at it long enough that he has “a pretty thick skin,” but he’s still curious “as to how people are interpreting things or how they’re hearing things. It’s always interesting.” Hardcore fans can be eerily accurate in reading what the song meant to him:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">They’ll parse a lyric and figure it out, like where it’s coming from. And I find that kind of amazing that people have the time to do that and the passion to do that. I think that’s pretty fantastic. It always amazes me, and I’m always really gratified when I read somebody reviewing something on the message board, and it’s like “Wow, you really got it. As far as from my angle, you really got it.” But I don’t think there’s only one way to interpret things. I mean, I know how I want to interpret them, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily the right way.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">Often, the meanings audiences make from music are personal. When Timmins meets his fans, they “want to express how a particular song or a group of songs or whatever have affected them. They want to talk about the music and tell their story. People usually want to just tell their story.”</p>
      <p>Stories are a particularly powerful speech genre for completing the communication loop between artist and audience. Timmins tells me that most musicians got into it</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">because as fans they’d been deeply touched by music in some way or another, and usually by a handful of bands or musicians, and they have their <a id="p38" class="page"></a>own stories as fans. So when that gets reversed and somebody’s coming up to you and telling you their story and how your music and what you’ve written or sung or played has deeply affected—it’s often extremely private and personal sections of their lives. It’s really amazing. It does validate the whole thing for you. You know, you go through periods where you think “What the hell am I doing this for, and who’s listening?” and then you only need one or two of those, and you go “Okay, well, right there that makes it—that’s worth it right there.” So it’s very important to hear those stories, I think.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Humans understand our experiences through stories. Timmins’s tale is a classic example of a story in which he, the protagonist, has a profound response to music. This leads him to a quest to make music.<a id="en106r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en106">13</a> The difficult path is threatened over and over by the Dragon of Doubt, but fans intervene, keeping the dragon at bay by recounting their own profound responses to his music. Timmins’s point—and all good stories have one<a id="en107r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en107">14</a>—is the importance of fan storytelling.</p>
      <p><a id="p39" class="page"></a>We need other people to recognize us in order to become ourselves.<a id="en108r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en108">15</a> When audiences validate musicians’ work, artists may feel the sense of affirming recognition that helps them become the person they want to be. Since what is recognized through music is often private and inarticulable, this recognition can create a particularly personal sense of connection. There is no greater validation for most musicians than seeing that their music made a difference for others. People need to feel needed. Rawlins writes: “In moments of extreme self-doubt we may believe that our actual presence on the earth makes no difference to anyone. These are times when we particularly need confirmation of our singular value from fellow persons. Feeling acknowledged and cared for by people in our world may call us back to ourselves through meaningful connections with others.”<a id="en109r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en109">16</a> To the extent that musicians have invested their work with their selves, seeing it acknowledged, cared for, accepted, and given meaning affirms their very humanity. Rawlins puts narrative practices, especially the stories we tell about turning points and significant moments in our lives, at the center of friendship.<a id="en110r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en110">17</a> Storytelling between friends brings the self into the other’s story and the other into the story of the self. Storytelling sustains and directs how we understand our past self and how we transcend that self moving forward. For musicians and audiences alike, the personal nature of fans’ stories can blur boundaries between friendship and distant relations, as well as between close relationships and therapeutic ones.</p>
      <h2 id="ah0102" class="ah">Music’s Social Work</h2>
      <p class="paft">Musicians find validation in hearing that their stories touched and helped others. Two particular kinds of stories were most meaningful to them—that their music had served as a sort of emotional therapy for others and that their music had facilitated others in building their own relationships. They also took special pleasure in the relationships they were able to build themselves as their music took them to people and places around the world.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0101" class="bh">Feeling</h3>
      <p class="paft">Composition and improvisation can help musicians process and step outside their own feelings and moods. Their performances, whether <a id="p40" class="page"></a>live or recorded, can help audiences do the same. Since ancient Greece, commentators have described music as a resource to shape feelings, moderate moods, motivate, and help us cope with difficulty.<a id="en111r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en111">18</a> Culture shapes the emotional meanings that music conveys and how it does so.<a id="en112r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en112">19</a> Across cultures, music serves this therapeutic function, taking us deep inside ourselves even as it transports us outside of ourselves.<a id="en113r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en113">20</a> Music offers “a special kind of ‘feelingful’ activity and engagement.”<a id="en114r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en114">21</a> It adds “another dimension to the human capacity to feel, a dimension not available except through music. Music is an essential way to expand, deepen, and vivify the feelings humans are able to experience. It is among the most powerful means humans possess to fulfill their need for an abundantly feelingful life.”<a id="en115r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en115">22</a> Music’s power to produce feeling forms the basis of its power as an entertainment medium, but it is also seen as threatening in some cultures. Islam, for instance, often forbids the use of music for purposes other than religion. In the Middle East and North Africa, the regions most likely to censor music, its affective resonance may be seen as a political challenge to government.<a id="en116r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en116">23</a></p>
      <p>I find Nacho Vegas’s songs exceptionally evocative, despite—or perhaps because of—my embarrassing incompetence in Spanish. I’ve spent countless hours feeling my heart crack a little when his voice cracks a little, feeling my anger rise when he yells. When I asked him to compare language to music, he described them as opposites, echoing Tomlinson’s discussion of how early-human gesture calls split into symbolic and nonsymbolic paths. “When you talk to a friend, you think in a logical way,” he said, choosing his words carefully, “but there is another way of communicating to people, a way that has nothing to do with logic, with your reason. These are the confusing things that you have to put in songs. You make a song, you don’t understand anything, but at least you got it and you can see it from outside and you say, ‘there is a better life of sensitivity that is hard to explain.’”</p>
      <p>Feelings we cannot articulate can be isolating. By evoking and communicating them, music helps overcome that isolation,<a id="en117r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en117">24</a> offering the gift of connection in the face of the inexpressible. When musicians see that their music helps others manage and celebrate their feelings, they know that their work matters and so too, by extension, do they.</p>
      <p>Recognizing a song’s feelings as your own requires cultural familiarity with musical genres and also a degree of self-identification.<a id="en118r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en118">25</a> Musical <a id="p41" class="page"></a>preferences “encode the power of your origins.”<a id="en119r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en119">26</a> Music can thus serve as a locus of identity that provides a sense of belonging. This can be particularly powerful for oppressed populations. Music, argues Mark Anthony Neal, has been crucial to “the construction of community within the African-American experience.”<a id="en120r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en120">27</a> In the racially segregated United States into the 1960s, the “Chitlin Circuit” of venues that allowed black musicians to perform, most famously New York’s Apollo Theater, “was invaluable for the creation of common aesthetic and cultural sensibilities among the African American diaspora.”<a id="en121r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en121">28</a></p>

      <p>The Cure have been striking in their ability to serve as figureheads for a subculture that stretches far beyond them. Their keyboard player, Roger O’Donnell, describes why: “It’s about them feeling that we understood it, and perhaps we went through it when we were their age, and that we’ve helped them. [They feel like] nobody else in the world understands what they’re going through, apart from the Cure and the Cure’s music. Time and time again people would come up to me and say, ‘I would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for the music of the Cure and that <a id="p42" class="page"></a>understanding.’ We don’t need to be going through what they’re going through. But I think we could understand it. We had an understanding for them.”</p>
      <p>O’Donnell attributes much of this to songwriter Robert Smith’s lyrics, but the same words set to up-tempo disco beats would hardly convey the necessary sense of darkness. Saving people from suicide is surely one of the most valuable things a human can do. Songs like R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts,” seem designed to give solace in times of darkness, and they do. But providing meaningful emotional help needn’t be so critical. It may just mean cheering people up for an evening. “At the most we’re just here 40 minutes to make songs, at least to entertain—if they’re in a shitty mood, get them in a better mood,” the American singer-songwriter Jill Sobule offers. “At least we can do that. We just provide a social service. Maybe we’re therapists or the garbage collector.”</p>
      <p>Zoë Keating talks about the emails she gets, “like I played this piece when my father was dying or I played this piece when my son was born.” The stories that stand out, for her and for the others, were those about providing comfort in difficult times. Keating recounts two that most moved her. One was from a scientist who wrote from a research expedition. “There was a storm. They were inside for six weeks. They couldn’t go outside. And they lay down in their bunks listening to my album.” The other came from a soldier stationed in Iraq: “He said he and his mates, his buddies, they liked to listen to my music while they were driving their tank across the desert in Iraq. And I was just imagining what that must be like. And I often think I make music for big open spaces, like that’s the perfect way to listen to music. And I was thinking that gosh, I hope that that makes it so that if they see somebody running across their field of view maybe my music would make it so they don’t shoot.”</p>
      <p>Musicians took particular joy in feeling they had soothed people who were suffering from illnesses. “I mean you get all sorts of bleeding heart situations where some girl has cerebral palsy and her mom wants tickets to the show and then you meet her,” one musician told me. Another illustrated his point with a story about a chronically ill teenage fan with whom he’d been corresponding. She got her grandfather to bring her across state lines to see his band.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs"><a id="p43" class="page"></a>It was like some kind of crazy pilgrimage for her. She was so happy to see the band. I got a million letters from her, about how much she liked us, and how “I wish I could come see you play” and stuff, and she was just a sweet, sweet girl. And it would realize apparently one of her life’s dreams by seeing us. And I felt so good about it. It was so nice to have this. At that point we had probably been corresponding for a couple of years, and finally getting a chance to see her at a show and meet her and talk to her was really really really nice.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pcon">The great Miles Davis spent most of his autobiography ignoring audiences, mentioning them only briefly as women who became lovers and supported him financially or crowds and critics at whom he was proudly unwilling to smile: “I didn’t look at myself as an entertainer like [Dizzy Gillespie and Louie Armstrong] did. I wasn’t going to do it just so that some non-playing, racist, white motherfucker could write some nice things about me. Naw, I wasn’t going to sell out my principles for them. I wanted to be accepted as a good musician and that didn’t call for no grinning.”<a id="en122r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en122">29</a></p>
      <p>But then, toward the end of his career and of the book, when he returned to the stage after a long absence, skeptical of his abilities, he found redemption in the approval of “this little crippled black guy who had cerebral palsy sitting down front in a wheelchair.” Davis</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="bqs">was playing this blues, and he was sitting right in front of the stage. I played it to him because I knew that <i>he</i> knew what the blues were. Halfway through my solo, I looked into this guy’s eyes, and he was crying. He reached up with his withered arm, which was trembling, and with his shaking hand he touched my trumpet as though he was blessing it—and me. Man I almost lost it right then and there, almost broke down myself and cried. . . . It was almost like he was telling me everything was all right and that my playing was as beautiful and strong as ever. I need that, needed it right at that moment to go on.<a id="en123r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en123">30</a></p>

      <p class="pcon">What’s telling about these stories is not the effect the artists had on those they perceived as ill or disabled, but the effect that their sense of having helped had on themselves. Disability serves as a “narrative prosthesis,” <a id="p44" class="page"></a>a “crutch upon which literary narratives lean.”<a id="en124r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en124">31</a> In such narratives, including the ones I’ve just recounted, disability is seen as unwanted, “what we flee in the past and hope to defeat in the future.”<a id="en125r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en125">32</a> By casting themselves as able to subvert others’ disability, if only temporarily, musicians can see themselves as transforming the unwanted into the desired. That the people of whom they speak may not see themselves as flawed, nor experience concerts any differently than their more able-bodied peers, is overlooked.</p>
      <p>The story musicians most often told was about learning they had helped someone through grief. All cultures use music to deal with death, though which musical qualities lend themselves to processing death are not universal.<a id="en126r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en126">33</a> The musicians might hear death stories in person, but usually they came through emails or private messages on social media platforms like Facebook. Steve Lawson, who makes ambient solo-bass music “for people who don’t like ambient music,” received an email that said, in its entirety, “My father just died. All I can do is listen to you.” After putting the sender’s name into Google, checking the Last.fm profile in the search results that tracked all of his recent listening activity and thus determining that he had indeed been playing his work on repeat, Lawson responded that he was humbled, and asked if there was anything more he could do. David Lowery, the frontman for both Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, who generally prefers to keep his audience at a formal distance, told me about getting a private message on Facebook from a fan he knew mostly from political arguments they’d had on his fan page. The message said that his mother was dying. Her last wish was to hear Lowery’s song “Take Me Down to the Infirmary.” Lowery was “stunned.” It had never occurred to him “that our music could penetrate that far into someone’s emotional life.”</p>
      <p>“Probably the most rewarding” experience for Greta Morgan “is actually really kind of a sad one.” There were two brothers who were really big fans. They “shared the music with their family and that kind of thing. And they both died in a car accident last summer.” Morgan heard that their father, who worked for a national radio broadcaster, had used one of her band’s songs repeatedly in an on-air remembrance. Her own father heard it and told her. She looked up the parents and sent a consolation note, telling them that the boys, who were handsome, charitable, charming, and great students, seemed incredible. A few months later, <a id="p45" class="page"></a>the mother began writing back. They struck up a correspondence. The parents created a foundation to benefit the charities for which the sons had worked. Morgan’s band played an event to honor the foundation, raising almost four thousand dollars, “which for a new band is a lot of money to be able to raise.” It was “a very sad but a very rewarding experience of seeing how even sending one note or playing one charity event can really brighten these people’s day or a few months, even though they’re going through this extreme kind of loss.”</p>

      <p>More than a decade after its release, Stephen Mason told me that people still tweet about how Jars of Clay’s “Valley Song,” with the lyric “When death, like a gypsy, comes to steal what I love, I will still look to the Heavens,” is helping them cope with loss. When they meet, fans tell them “that song gave me language for something that I didn’t have words for.” “What I think poetry does at its best,” Mason reflects, “is it gives new words to feelings and maybe helps develop a new context to understand feelings. So that’s why we love what we do. That’s a large part of it.”</p>
      <p>There’s an affective cycle with music. Musicians give shape to inchoate feelings through song. Those songs help others live with their own emotions. They show musicians their own feelings, and this can create feelings of compassion, gratitude, humility, and self-worth in the musicians, validating the significance of their work and giving them incentives<a id="p46" class="page"></a> to continue. At the same time, musicians aren’t therapists, and they don’t have the explicit boundaries and professional codes of ethics that bound and guide their relationships with their audiences as they share these intimate moments. It can get too close for comfort. As we will see in chapter 6, a few people move from the sense of shared emotion to the illusion of close relationship.</p>
      <p>It may also be that once musicians have been able to step outside their feelings through song, the cycles of audience response keep pulling them back to the pain. Morgan wrote a song to help her deal with a close friend’s suicide. She never talked about the song’s origin, or even that it was about suicide, but some of the images were clear enough that people who had lost someone to suicide “sensed that was what the song was about.” At shows, fans would approach her to talk about losing an uncle or a close friend to suicide. “They want to have this really intense conversation with me and connect on it.” From her perspective, it had taken a long time to deal with her grief. She’d written the song, she’d put it out there, and she was done. She appreciated her audience’s openness and confidence but didn’t want to deal with the “waves of emotion” these conversations aroused.</p>
      <h3 id="bh0102" class="bh">Relationship</h3>
      <p class="paft">Christopher Small argues that the way music arouses emotion lets us explore relationships experientially. “The act of musicking establishes in the place where it is happening a set of relationships,” he writes, “and it is in those relationships that the meaning of the act lies.”<a id="en127r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en127">34</a> He posits that music is not so much about relationships “which actually exist in our lives as about those that we desire to exist and long to experience: relationships among people, as well as those between people and the rest of the cosmos, and also perhaps with ourselves and with our bodies and even with the supernatural, if our conceptual world has room for the supernatural.”<a id="en128r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en128">35</a> Yet music often does foster relationships that actually exist. For some musicians, this may be the reason to make music. “The whole point of being an artist,” writes Amanda Palmer, is “to be connected to people. To make a family. A family you were with all the time, like it or not.”<a id="en129r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en129">36</a> Music brings people together as cultures, as subcultures, <a id="p47" class="page"></a>and as individuals, connecting “the ‘we’ and the ‘I’ without subordinating one to the other.”<a id="en130r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en130">37</a></p>
      <p>Much has been made of music’s ability to foster subcultural distinction.<a id="en131r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en131">38</a> The performing arts are “fulcrums of identity, allowing people to intimately feel themselves part of the community through the realization of shared cultural knowledge and style and through the very act of participating together in performance.”<a id="en132r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en132">39</a> Music helps people feel a sense of belonging with others in a transnational subculture, in local contexts, and in dyadic relationships. Finding meaning in music is “a continual process of drawing social boundaries between those who are ‘like us’ and those who are not.”<a id="en133r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en133">40</a> For many, music provides solidarity in the face of public cultures that do not feel like home. Fans of the Cure were “the weird ones at school,” as O’Donnell put it. “You wore black clothes and you had black hair. You were pretty depressed, and you were on the margins.” The Cure gave the fans “something to make them feel not so alone” and around which they could build a subculture of people who felt marginalized. One need only look at the commonalities among fandoms around the boy bands of the day over time (think of One Direction’s “Directioneers” or Justin Bieber’s “Beliebers”, fandoms around the Beatles, or my own 1970s preteen fan experiences described in chapter 3) to see that they have much more to do with the pleasures and lessons girls experience in building community with one another through common practices that set them apart from other demographic groups than with the specific young men around whom those practices take form.</p>
      <p>Transnational fandoms may take distinctive local forms as people use music to speak to their concrete conditions. Emma Baulch describes this in the context of death metal fandom in Bali, where metal fans adopted “the universal death metal aesthetic” and began performing metal publicly and locally as a means of positioning themselves against the tourism dominating their region.<a id="en134r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en134">41</a> They viewed this genre, in contrast to the more popular and tourist-friendly genre of reggae, as a “spirited expression of the soul which, in their view, conflicted with tourism’s demands.”<a id="en135r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en135">42</a> Similarly, in rural Texas, where Aaron Fox spent years playing and studying in honky-tonks, “Real Country” was a genre, an identity and a shared social experience, even though, as Peterson shows, the genre of “country” was manufactured in part by urban businessmen far <a data-locator="p48" class="page"></a>from Texas or other parts of the American rural south.<a id="en136r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en136">43</a> “Speaking and singing artfully, improvisationally, and with minimal reference to exchange value have remained essential to the social construction of history, identity, and sociability” in the region despite difficult times and the profusion of mass-mediated culture in everyday life.<a id="en137r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en137">44</a></p>

      <p>The British political indie-folk singer Billy Bragg is particularly passionate about the sense of solidarity among his audience members. People often tell him live performances of his song “I Keep Faith” made them cry. When he plays it, he introduces the song by talking about his faith in the audience’s ability to change the world. “I’m just a guy,” he tells them: “I just play guitar. I’m gone tomorrow, you’re still here. It’s your job to change the world. Look at this room full of people. They all want to change the world too. All I can do is bring you together and make you feel like you’re not alone, and you have to go out and do it. Believe in those people standing ten yards behind you in the dark, that you’ve never met. Now if push comes to shove they’ll stand beside you for the things that you care about.” On one level, he tells me, the lyrics are about his wife, something their son is eager to remind him. But it’s also about his politics and his beliefs about social order. “It’s about trusting strangers,” he says, “the fundamental underpinning of socialism and solidarity.”</p>
      <p>Bragg has a community of fans who hang out in his web forum. “They’re really good people,” he tells me. “I’ve known some literally for my entire career. I’ve watched them go from a drunk climbing on stage to dance with me to being married with children.” These audience members may not even like his music anymore, but going to his gigs together is integral to their relationships. “I spoke to one of them the other day,” <a id="p49" class="page"></a>he says, “and she’s absolutely clear she’s not listened to an album I made in the last ten years.” He doesn’t worry about that. “It doesn’t bother me, the fact that I provide them with a social framework.” He tears up telling me about the death of a man on his forum who was the longtime partner of the group’s most prolific member. “We’re not just talking about fans,” he sighs. “This is something else. These are friends.” Musicians’ power to foster this kind of social solidarity among their fans raises issues of how to position themselves vis-à-vis fans and the communities they build. We will return to this in chapter 4.</p>
      <p>Music also brings people together as pairs and helps support their ongoing relationships. Many of the artists I spoke with glowed as they talked about learning how their music had helped strengthen relationships. Timmons reflected on a “punked out or gothed out” young man who approached him after the show. “Me and my dad never got along. We couldn’t agree on anything, we were always fighting,” he told him. “The only thing that we ever, ever connected with was your music.” The father had died six months earlier. Norwegian rock star Sivert Høyem offered a nearly identical experience, “Sometimes I get personal messages, people send me a message about how they were at a gig with their father and how they really connected through the music.”</p>
      <p>Two of Jill Sobule’s fans, one in New York and the other in Salt Lake City, began writing to each other after realizing both were fans. Soon they were writing every day. They fell in love, but they had no money to meet. Sobule dreamed of running a Kickstarter campaign to fly them to see her and put them up in a fancy hotel. “You talk about things with fans,” she says to me. “Any time you can be a matchmaker, that’s the best. When you get fans that are saying ‘I met someone through your music,’ I mean, it’s like making whoopee! That’s when I feel like ‘Wow, I’m creating a social service!’”</p>
      <p>Musicians move in worlds where music is the basis of their own friendships with one another, with other people in music, and with their audience members in different locations. These relationships, developed through and around music, provide them with grounding in a transitory and unstable lifestyle. “One of the great things about music,” the American indie artist Conner Oberst told music journalist Greg Kot, “is how you discover it and share it. It’s based on friendships. I think most of the people I care about in the world I somehow met through music. It’s just <a id="p50" class="page"></a>such a powerful force. I think all art is meant to be communicated to other people and it’s hard to put a price tag on things like that.”<a id="en138r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en138">45</a> Vegas likewise celebrates music’s ability to connect him to individuals everywhere he plays. “You know a lot of people in every place you play. And you always play music, and you always talk about music, and talking about music, it’s something similar to talking about life. And you talk about music and then you talk about life. I made a bunch of friends that I know, just from playing someplace. You get your mind more open just by playing and knowing people and being in different places. It’s one of the greatest things about being in music.”</p>

      <p>Touring musicians often speak of the value of meeting people from other countries. “Travel is one of the great parts of being a musician, forming those connections all over the world,” said Richie Hawtin. Hawtin, an electronica artist who often performs behind a curtain with an LED light display that obscures his view of the audience, actively looks for them before shows to compensate for that distance. “Like if I’m playing Korea I might go on Twitter and ask ‘where is everyone?’ And <a id="p51" class="page"></a>someone will say ‘they’re eating salted squid next to the venue.’ So I’ll go there and try and meet some people.” Originally from Canada and often associated with Detroit, Hawtin reflected on his years playing in Japan: “When I started way back playing in Japan my friends there—we didn’t even speak the same language. But electronic music, because there’s no vocals, it reaches people at a very emotional primal level. And we could build on that to become good friends. The music industry doesn’t talk about it. They all think about sales. But if you talk to musicians they’ll all tell you that’s a really big part of it, when people from different cultures connect around music, that’s really powerful.”</p>
      <p>The internet has broadened the geographic range within which artists can tour. An independent Swedish band, like the ethereal dream pop duo Club 8, may make a year’s worth of income touring Asia or Brazil, where they have huge audiences if few record sales. A Scottish band like Mogwai, who did quite well in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States, may sell fewer records than they used to, but become popular in places like South America and Asia where they would never have had audiences before the internet. A Spaniard like Vegas may reach audiences in <a id="p52" class="page"></a>Spanish-speaking nations in the Americas he could not have found before without negotiating label deals for each country. The connections formed through touring can also come home. Steve Lawson has toured with huge acts but prefers playing house concerts. His favorite thing is “when people who we know off the internet go, ‘Do you want to come and play in my house? I can pull together 25 friends and they’re happy to pay 15 bucks each to hear you play.’” He and his wife Lobelia, also a musician, make many friends this way. Then they reciprocate, hosting house concerts for other musicians, or “they just come and stay for a holiday.”</p>

      <h2 id="ah0103" class="ah">Music as Gift</h2>
      <p class="paft">Music is communication that does social work. Musicians work in the realms of commerce and sociality simultaneously, called on the one hand to be the focus of attention, selling their personas and wares, and, on the other, people communicating with other people, therapists, social service workers, and friends. Music, when it works, circulates. Its energy moves from artists to audience, among audiences, and back from audience to artists. Mason, whose band won Grammy awards and sold millions of records, describes it as life-giving: “Artists are alive when they create. And people that consume art are alive when they receive it, and they pass it on and they share it. And that’s the antithesis of the music industry that we came out of.”</p>
      <p>Lewis Hyde’s influential book <i>The Gift</i> argues that music, like all art, circulates in two economies simultaneously, one social and the other economic.<a id="en139r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en139">46</a> <i>The Gift</i> has become a touchstone for those seeking to reclaim the social value of art from an ever more mercenary market framing, as well as for fan-funding advocates such as Amanda Palmer who, in her own book <i>The Art of Asking</i>, cites <i>The Gift</i> heavily to explain how she got fans to give her more than a million dollars on Kickstarter when she had asked for only $100,000.<a id="en140r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en140">47</a> The bifurcation of messy realities into two distinct economies is simplistic. Economic and intimate activity “often sustain each other,”<a id="en141r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en141">48</a> even if the former is seen (erroneously, Zelizer argues) as a threat to the latter. “In all social settings, intimate and impersonal alike,” says Zelizer, “social ties and economic transactions mingle, as human beings perform relational work by matching <a id="p53" class="page"></a>their personal ties and economic activity.”<a id="en142r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en142">49</a> Nonetheless, the economic/social distinction is analytically useful.</p>
      <p>As abstract ideal types, economic and social exchanges differ in a number of ways.<a id="en143r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en143">50</a> In the gift economy, art circulates as a present, moving from artist to friend, friend to friend, or child to parent. The basis of exchange is trust. What is owed and when it is due are unspecified, as we trust that presents will make their way to us in due time. The exchange creates a sense of connection and obligation. The same thing has different values depending on who gives it to you. In the market economy, art circulates as a product sold from producers to consumers. Economic exchanges are based on legal principles. There are clear terms of exchange with explicit time frames for payment. The transaction is impersonal, leaving no sense of gratitude or obligation. What’s exchanged could come from anyone else and have the same value.</p>
      <p>Social and economic exchanges are dialectical, indivisible yet defining each other by their contrasts and synergies. Once money became a way to mediate music, music’s social value could no longer be understood apart from its economic value. Even music that happens entirely outside of commercial spheres, say singing around a campfire or at a party, becomes understood partly in terms of its noncommercial quality. When music circulates within commercial spheres, the market frame can lessen its social value. When money mediates interactions, it is harder to see the social processes they create and embody.<a id="en144r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en144">51</a> Without the resonance of gift giving, Hyde posits, “there is no art.”<a id="en145r" class="enref" href="baym-0023.xhtml#en145">52</a></p>
      <p>Musicians find their validation in the social consequences of their work for their audiences and themselves, but they often work within a commercial context that treats their work not as a gift, but as a product. Today, that commercial environment is unstable and confusing. The kinds of exchange that are in play are interwoven in ways that are new and continuously changing. It’s unclear which offerings will be reciprocated with money. The new strategy of reaching out to audiences with relational labor, trying to build relationships that feel close in hopes of evoking the communal bonds that make money an appropriate way to repay the gift of music, in many ways honors music’s ancient origins. The value of musical work has always resided in communication and connection. Any efforts to make music economically profitable must be built on this premise.</p>
