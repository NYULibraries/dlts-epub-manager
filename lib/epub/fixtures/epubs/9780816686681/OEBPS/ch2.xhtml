		<h2>2 OBVIOUS GAYS AND THE STATE GAZE</h2>
		<h4>Gay Visibility and Immigration Policy during the Mariel Boatlift</h4>
		
		<h3>Armando&#x2019;s Story</h3>
		<p>On the day Armando went to the police station to ask for permission to leave Cuba, he wore the gayest outfit he could find. Having been dissuaded from being a teacher because he was so &#x201C;obvious,&#x201D; Armando had experienced firsthand how a visible gay man&#x2019;s life might be limited in Cuba. Although spared the more intense forms of repression faced by others of his generation, Armando was determined to see if the tumultuous events in Cuba during the summer of 1980&#x2014;events that would come to be known as the Mariel boatlift&#x2014;would really culminate in the promise of exile.</p>
		<p>During our interview almost twenty years later, he explained how he had purposely picked out a flowery shirt and a little chain that fit snugly around his neck (&#x201C;una cadenita bien pegadita al cuello&#x201D;) for his interview with the Cuban police officials who would decide whether he should receive an exit permit. In the Cuba of 1980, such fashion choices were seen as gender transgressive, so Armando hoped they would confirm that he was a counterrevolutionary homosexual who would, therefore, be permitted to leave the country. Before this day, he had thought his homosexuality was obvious, but for this important interview with Cuban officials he did not rely on the everyday visibility of his homosexuality: instead, he made sure to perform the <span class="italic">loca, </span>the gender-transgressive effeminate homosexual man. Armando successfully passed the test. The Cuban state identified him as socially undesirable, <span class="italic">escoria </span>(scum), and homosexual, designations that facilitated his exit from the country. At age twenty-six, Armando crossed the Florida Straits on a ship named the <span class="italic">Spirit of Ecstasy.</span>
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, his ecstasy soon gave way to confusion and instability. Armando describes a chaotic scene in Florida. Mariel entrants were required to have a sponsor (either a family member or a volunteer) in order to be released from state custody. Although Armando did have an uncle who was willing to sponsor him, a miscommunication after Armando arrived in Florida prevented him from making contact with that uncle. Thus, like many Mariel entrants, Armando was taken to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, one of several resettlement camps around the country. He spent two months there, but he tells me it felt like two centuries. He does not remember if camp officials asked him about his sexuality. On July 4, 1980, after successfully contacting his uncle, Armando left Fort Chaffee.</p>
		<p>Armando&#x2019;s convincing performance of the ostentatious homosexual facilitated his exit from Cuba, but it was unclear how a similar performance might affect his entry into the United States. The clarity with which he recalls his exit interview with Cuban police contrasts sharply with his recollection of how or whether sexuality was considered during his processing by U.S. authorities. While the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) might have evidenced a certain lack of interest in this particular immigrant&#x2019;s sexuality, the historical record suggests that the agency was, in fact, quite concerned with matters of sex and sexuality in its broader handling of the boatlift. As this chapter demonstrates, the U.S. government&#x2014;from national, state, and local politicians to INS officials to local law enforcement&#x2014;demonstrated a strong but troubled interest in the sexuality of Cuban Mariel immigrants.</p>
		<p>In this chapter I examine the state gaze in relation to male homosexuals on both sides of the Florida Straits. I use the term <span class="italic">gaze </span>to describe both the methods used by the state to identify sexual populations and to highlight how these identification systems intersected with state interests and desires.<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> The state&#x2019;s gaze relied on an assumption of readily identifiable gayness. In practical terms, the state&#x2019;s interest in homosexuality necessitated a mechanism by which the state could identify the gay population. As Armando&#x2019;s case makes clear, in Cuba this mechanism involved openly evaluating visible markers of homosexuality. In contrast, his vague account of his experience in the United States suggests that the state&#x2019;s long-standing interest in sexuality conflicted with the special treatment previously accorded Cuban refugees under Cold War immigration policies. This conflict required that U.S. authorities develop a more selective gaze, sometimes seeing and sometimes refusing to see homosexual Mariel Cubans.</p>
		<p>As I trace the migration process of homosexual Cuban men like Armando, I put the state gaze in national context. I analyze how both states defined homosexuals, the identification procedures used by both, and both states&#x2019; vested interests in their own identificatory practices. In Cuba, the state facilitated the exit of visible homosexuals, a group already stigmatized by official discourses and state policies. In this case, state interests were served by clearly identifying homosexuals in order to expedite their departure. The U.S. federal government&#x2019;s role in processing and identifying homosexuals was much more complicated.</p>
		<p>During the Cold War, relations between the United States and Cuba were tense, at best. Because of this political acrimony, Cubans seeking to enter the United States had been accorded preferential treatment for their symbolic value as a people fleeing communism. However, homosexuals had been formally and categorically excluded by U.S. immigration policy. Even as Armando and other gay-identified Mariel Cubans were traveling by boat to Florida, the United States was recodifying a long-standing immigration policy that explicitly excluded homosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> Because of its massive scale, the Mariel migration also posed procedural challenges to any systematic identification of immigrant characteristics. Finally, given the national media attention focused on the boatlift, the identification of homosexuals posed a public relations dilemma for the U.S. government. I examine these complications by focusing on how homosexual Cuban men entering the United States were seen and not seen by the U.S. state gaze. During the boatlift, conflicting immigration policies and procedures clashed, as men who were both Cuban and visibly gay entered the country under the glare of the media spotlight.</p>
		
		<h3>Leaving Cuba</h3>
		<p>A week after a bus driver drove his busload of asylum seekers into the Peruvian embassy in Havana on March 28, 1980, Fidel Castro announced that anyone seeking asylum would be allowed to leave Cuba and withdrew the troops guarding the embassy. Two days after the announcement, over ten thousand Cubans had crowded into the embassy hoping to hold Castro to his word.</p>
		<p>The first wave of emigrations from the Peruvian embassy consisted of air flights to Costa Rica followed by eventual resettlement in countries that had agreed to accept a predetermined number of immigrants, including Costa Rica, Peru, Spain, and the United States.<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> After the international news media began to circulate images of the celebratory arrival of Cuban migrants to Costa Rica, Castro announced that Cubans could leave the country only by flying directly to their final destination, thereby lessening the spectacle of fleeing Cubans disembarking en masse. In 1980, a total of seventy-five hundred Cubans emigrated through these flights.<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></p>
		<p>This more orderly phase of emigration ended on April 20, when Castro announced that all Cubans wishing to leave the island would be allowed to depart&#x2014;but only through the port of Mariel&#x2014;and invited their Cuban American relatives to pick them up. What followed was a massive flotilla, and by October, 124,776 Cubans had arrived in the United States.</p>
		<p>Tensions in Cuba escalated as more Cubans sought an opening to leave the country while others demonstrated against them. Under the circumstances, Castro needed to explain why so many Cubans wanted to emigrate. He responded with a discourse that disparaged hopeful emigrants and characterized those who wanted to leave as undesirables, antisocial elements, lumpen proletariat, and <span class="italic">escoria, </span>and he added that the United States was &#x201C;performing a tremendous sanitary service&#x201D; by accepting them.<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> Cubans on the island who had not declared their desire to leave were encouraged to demonstrate against those who had by participating in <span class="italic">actos de repudio </span>(acts of repudiation) against the <span class="italic">escoria. </span>In the United States, the media picked up on this characterization of the migrants, and news reports repeatedly affirmed that Castro had emptied his prisons by sending criminals to the United States and that the migrants included members of other undesirable groups such as mental patients, prostitutes, and homosexuals. In addition, both the U.S. media and the South Florida Cuban American community began commenting on the demographic and cultural differences between the Mariel immigrants and previous groups of Cuban immigrants. The perceived racial and class difference of the so-called Marielitos added to their stigmatization and contrasted sharply with the historically preferential treatment of light-skinned immigrants to the United States, a special treatment accorded previous generations of anticommunist Cuban refugees. Racialization, class stigma, and sexual deviance were thus embedded in coverage of the Mariel migration, reinforcing the notion that these migrants were no loss to Cuba and posed a potential problem for the United States.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></p>
		<p>As the Cuban government began sorting out those who wanted to leave on the boatlift, it developed a selective process to facilitate the exit of those already identified as undesirable. By prioritizing undesirables, Cuban officials hoped to eliminate problem populations. When Cuban Americans arrived in Cuba with empty boats hopeful that they would be reunited with family members, they were required to transport not only their relatives but also other people the Cuban government had approved for departure, among them homosexuals, criminals, and the mentally ill.</p>
		<p>Once the bureaucratic process for requesting permission to leave Cuba began to develop, word spread that homosexuals would be allowed to leave the country. As discussed in chapter 1, prior to 1980, the Cuban state had targeted homosexual men, most of whom had suffered a range of consequences from limited career options to detention in reeducation camps. The state had especially targeted gender-transgressive, ostentatious, or obvious homosexuals. Once the boatlift phase of Mariel began, this state identification facilitated exit from the country: some Cuban homosexuals were even given the choice of serving jail time or leaving the country to encourage their departure.<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Others, like Armando, were able to request permission to leave.<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> Drawing on interviews with 180 Mariel entrants, Margarita Garcia concluded that anyone &#x201C;who went to the police station and declared him or herself to be a homosexual could get an exit permit.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup> She added that documentation of their antisocial status, such as proof of previous detention under the Law of Dangerousness, could further facilitate the process.<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> In a speech in May 1980, Castro denied that anyone was being forced to leave the country, but added that &#x201C;we have the right to authorize the exit of the antisocial elements, and that is what we&#x2019;re doing.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></p>
		<p>Accounts of gay men who went through this declaration process reveal the ways in which authorities evaluated and confirmed homosexuality to facilitate hasty exits. For example, in memoirs written shortly after the Mariel boatlift, Antonio L. Conchez describes how he and a childhood friend declared themselves homosexuals to Cuban police after he found out that homosexuals were being given permission to leave. After taking their statements, the police asked them to return the following day to pick up &#x201C;official letters confirming that we were homosexuals, thieves, marijuana users, antisocials and counterrevolutionaries.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> Conchez did not initially receive the letter because he was identified by the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR) as being a good student and coming from a decent family. According to his account, he was ready for the challenge presented by his good social standing:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>I had gone prepared with an eye-catching outfit, my hair messed up and a little bit of make-up on my eyes and face. I also spoke in a fake voice, exaggerating my mannerisms so that they would be convinced that I was a homosexual, and then I talked to them and I pleaded with them to give me that letter. And God let it be so, and they gave me the letter where it said I was the scum of society, that I did not work or study, that I had been imprisoned, that I was not in favor of the revolutionary process and other additional horrors and slanders.<sup><a id="footnote_back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Similarly, in <span class="italic">Antes que anochezca (Before Night Falls), </span>the author Reinaldo Arenas describes his exit interview. In his case, homosexuality marked him as undesirable and, therefore, a good candidate for an exit visa; however, because he had published his work outside Cuba he was banned from leaving the country. He therefore presented himself to authorities as a <span class="italic">loca </span>and made no reference to his literary contributions. He brought along his <span class="italic">carn&#xE9; de identidad </span>(identification card) where his previous charge for having caused a &#x201C;public scandal&#x201D; was reported. He explains the processing at a local police station:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>At the police station they asked me if I was a homosexual and I said yes; then they asked me if I was active or passive and I took the precaution of saying that I was passive. . . . The Cuban government did not look upon those who took the active male role as real homosexuals. There were also some women psychologists there. They made me walk in front of them to see if I was queer <span class="italic">(si era loca o no). </span>I passed the test, and a lieutenant yelled to another officer, &#x201C;Send this one directly.&#x201D; This meant that I did not have to go through any further police investigation.<sup><a id="footnote_back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>With his public scandal arrest and his <span class="italic">loca </span>strut for the psychologists, Arenas was certified as a visible homosexual and allowed to leave the country &#x201C;como una loca m&#225;s.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></p>
		<p>Evidence indicates that many who did not consider themselves homosexuals claimed to be in order to leave the country. Arenas himself says that &#x201C;people who were not even homosexual pretended to be gay in order to leave the country.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> It is important to remember, however, that even those who had previously identified as homosexual also performed gayness in these exit interviews. When Armando picked out his flowery shirt, Conchez exaggerated his mannerisms, and Arenas strutted for the psychologists, they were deliberately performing the category of flamboyant, effeminate homosexual for state officials.</p>
		<p>The category of homosexual was reinforced, constructed, and redefined in these interactions. All these accounts confirm that the officially recognized (and stigmatized) homosexual was a gender-transgressive male who took the passive sexual role and whose public behavior was ostentatious. As men who understood themselves to be homosexual performed this <span class="italic">loca </span>character, they reflected the official caricature of the homosexual back at the state that had heightened its stigmatization. There is a bit of condescension here, for the men exaggerated a stereotype that they knew did not encompass who they were or who homosexuals were in general. This consciously constructed performance was not a cheap joke, however, because the test had real consequences. If the men were convincing, authorities expedited their exit from the country. If they were not convincing, not only would they be refused an exit permit but would be marked as wanting to leave&#x2014;a uncomfortably counterrevolutionary position given the acts of repudiation directed at the <span class="italic">escoria. </span>Their detailed accounts also suggest a bit of liberation in the performances, for these men exaggerated effeminate or ostentatious mannerisms precisely in front of those government officials from whom they would most likely have hidden under normal circumstances.</p>
		<p>At this moment in Cuban history, state policy toward homosexuals, while still oppressive, was quite unambiguous. Homosexuals continued to be stigmatized and defined as alien to the Cuban national project. The most socially dangerous homosexual type was further crystallized as the effeminate, gender-transgressive, ostentatious, passive homosexual man. As these accounts illustrate, homosexual men understood the state&#x2019;s categorization scheme and aptly performed the expected role. In other words, because the state had persecuted visible homosexuals and because passive homosexuals were the most despised subgroup, men seeking permission to leave Cuba deliberately claimed the passive role and displayed the outward gender markers that proved ostentatious homosexuality to the police.</p>
		<p>Thus the interests of the Cuban state and homosexuals wishing to leave Cuba coincided in unexpected ways. Between 1959 and 1980, emigration from Cuba was increasingly controlled, and expressing a desire to leave the country was viewed as a political betrayal. By 1980 though, the Cuban state embraced the opportunity to remove homosexuals from the island in order to enhance the virile image of the revolutionary nation and prevent possible future resistance from this stigmatized group. Cuba&#x2019;s neat binary between the masculine socialist man and the effeminate capitalist homosexual (and the state policies legitimated by this binary) had been troubled by the overlap between leftist supporters and gay/lesbian political activists outside the island. Cuban persecution of homosexuals, as witnessed by visiting U.S. leftists on the Venceremos Brigade, for example, was insulting to some gays, lesbians, and their allies.<sup><a id="footnote_back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> The international Left split on this issue, and this split had weakened the support base of the revolution. Eliminating homosexuals from the population (through voluntary or semivoluntary departure) was an easy way to sidestep this dilemma.</p>
		<p>The migration of a large number of homosexuals, a minority group also stigmatized in the United States, also helped explain the mass exodus in a way that was favorable to the revolution. According to the official Cuban discourse, the mass exodus did not prove the failure of the revolution. Rather, the hopeful emigrants were all undesirables, the lazy lumpen dregs of society consumed by the vices of capitalism (homosexuality, crime, prostitution, etc.). By including and drawing attention to groups widely stigmatized in the United States, the Cuban state was able to discredit the emigrants, support its own revolutionary image, and create future challenges for the immigrants.</p>
		<p>In general, those factors that may have motivated emigration are not easy to disentangle.<sup><a id="footnote_back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> Some Cuban homosexuals might have wanted to leave the island because of repression, while others might have been more motivated by economic concerns. Regardless of motivation, Mariel provided a brief opening for those who wished to emigrate. In contrast to previous Cuban state policies toward homosexuals, the identification of homosexuals during Mariel in effect provided a desired outcome (at least for those homosexuals who <span class="italic">wanted </span>to leave) as opposed to a repressive consequence.</p>
		
		<h3>Entering the United States</h3>
		<p>In the United States, the interests of the state and of homosexuals did not line up so neatly. Homosexual Cuban immigrants, ostentatious ones at that, presented three major complications for this receiving nation. The first complication was that homosexual Cuban Marielitos embodied many of the existing contradictions and ambiguities of U.S. immigration policies. On the one hand, since the rise of the Cold War, the United States had warmly received Cuban immigrants, using their desire to leave Cuba as proof of the failure of communism. On the other hand, the United States had a long-standing, albeit selectively enforced, ban against homosexual entrants. These two policies clashed on the bodies of gay Cubans.</p>
		<p>Whereas in Cuba the state actively sought to identify homosexuals in order to expel them and homosexuals actively identified themselves to the state in order to facilitate their own expulsion, in the United States the purpose and the process of identification was inconsistent and often contradictory. The U.S. state had competing imperatives: to see and not to see the homosexual Cubans. How these conflicting policies would be put into practice posed the second complication. The identification of Cuban homosexuals was complicated by the fact that not all Mariel Cubans were processed in the same way. Rather, they were processed by federal, state, local, and voluntary agencies in different locations throughout the United States. These bureaucratic and jurisdictional differences inevitably led to disparate identification procedures.</p>
		<p>A final complication resulted from the flood of national media attention that surrounded Mariel. The U.S. government was no less interested than Cuba in the public relations impact of the boatlift. For an international audience, the boatlift could confirm the failure of Cuban communism and the supremacy of U.S. capitalism: why else would so many desperate Cubans want to come to the United States? At home, the reinforcement of U.S. superiority also served to quiet growing uneasiness about a weak national economy. Given the economic situation and the upcoming presidential election, domestic perception of the Mariel immigrants was especially important. Would voters perceive them as valued immigrants who would contribute to the U.S. economy (as they had perceived the &#x201C;golden exiles&#x201D; who preceded Mariel), or would they perceive them as undesirable immigrants who threatened national well-being?</p>
		
		<h3>Immigration Policy Conflict: To Exclude or to Welcome?</h3>
		<p>Few Mariel Cubans were defined as either political refugees or asylees.<sup><a id="footnote_back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> Instead, they were issued paroles, and a new category was created for them, namely, &#x201C;Cuban&#x2013;Haitian entrant (status pending).&#x201D; This ambiguous status allowed them physical but not legal entrance into the country, and it became the foundation for the systematic denial of rights to Mariel Cubans.<sup><a id="footnote_back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> Unlike previous Cuban immigrants who had been processed by the Cuban Refugee Program, this new wave became &#x201C;the first sizeable group of Cuban immigrants to experience the Immigration and Naturalization Service&#x2019;s personnel and operations.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> Therefore most Mariel Cubans encountered more difficult immigration procedures and policy hurdles than the post-1959 Cuban immigrants who preceded them.</p>
		<p>Homosexual Mariel immigrants faced an additional hurdle because just as they were entering the United States, the INS was redefining its homosexual exclusion policy. As Eithne Luibh&#xE9;id explains in <span class="italic">Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality at the Border, </span>homosexuals had been formally excluded from entering the United States since the early 1950s. Beginning in 1952, people identified as homosexual had been issued Class A medical exclusions because they were classified as having &#x201C;psychopathic personality.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> Between 1965 and 1979, homosexuals were reclassified as &#x201C;sexual deviates&#x201D; and still subjected to Class A medical exclusions.<sup><a id="footnote_back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> However, in 1979&#x2014;six years after the American Psychological Association&#x2019;s 1973 decision to drop homosexuality as a mental illness&#x2014;the surgeon general ordered the Public Health Service to stop issuing automatic Class A medical exclusions to homosexuals. This order denied the INS the bureaucratic identification mechanism that had facilitated homosexual exclusion.<sup><a id="footnote_back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">24</a></sup></p>
		<p>The INS had yet to resolve the situation when, between April and late September 1980, a sizable population of gay men and women&#x2014;Armando among them&#x2014;entered the United States from Cuba. It was not until September 1980, with the boatlift almost over, that the INS responded with a new policy on homosexual exclusion designed specifically to bypass the surgeon general&#x2019;s order. Given the timing of the decision, we can deduce that the INS felt the need to clarify its policy in order to deal with the sudden mass influx of immigrants and the increasing media questions about homosexual Cuban migrants. On September 8, acting INS commissioner David Crosland sent an agency memo announcing the new procedures, which no longer required medical certification from the Public Health Service. According to the new policy, &#x201C;aliens&#x201D; were not to be asked about their sexual preference during &#x201C;primary inspection.&#x201D; However, if &#x201C;an alien [made] an unsolicited, unambiguous oral or written admission of homosexuality&#x201D; or if &#x201C;a third party who presents himself or herself for inspection voluntarily states, without prompting or prior questioning, that an alien who arrived in the United States at the same time and is then being processed for admission is a homosexual,&#x201D; then a private, professionally administered &#x201C;secondary inspection&#x201D; of the alien would follow. Crosland&#x2019;s memo directed that, during this secondary inspection, the alien &#x201C;shall be asked <span class="italic">only </span>whether he or she is homosexual. If the answer is &#x2018;no,&#x2019; the alien shall not be detained for further examination as to homosexuality. If the answer is &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; the alien shall be asked to sign a statement to that effect . . . [and] he or she shall be referred to an immigration judge for an exclusion proceeding.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">25</a></sup></p>
		<p>Gay rights activists, who had been struggling against the INS&#x2019;s broadly construed gay and lesbian exclusion policies, perceived this new policy as a partial victory. In fact, in a press release, the National Gay Task Force called this an &#x201C;immigration victory for gays&#x201D; because with the new policy, &#x201C;gay aliens [would] no longer be subject to probing interrogation on their private sexual life by immigration authorities.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> Under the new policy, people entering the United States were no longer to be singled out because of gay pride paraphernalia such as books and T-shirts, and it would be easier for gay men and lesbians to avoid identification by the state. Moreover, even if individuals did make a declaration of their homosexuality during primary inspection, they could simply answer that they were not gay in the secondary inspection and the INS would not detain them.</p>
		<p>For Cuban men whose identification as homosexual had just facilitated their exit from Cuba, avoiding state identification in the United States might not have been an obvious strategy. Although national gay rights activists viewed the new INS procedures as an improvement over previous methods, the new policy did continue to exclude homosexuals who made an &#x201C;unsolicited, unambiguous&#x201D; statement to INS inspectors; thus these inspectors became the official new front line in homosexual identification. Nevertheless, while this new policy continued to allow the federal government to exclude homosexuals, it also provided room for plausible deniability that could be used to allow entrance of obvious homosexuals arriving from Cuba.</p>
		<p>Even after the INS&#x2019;s ostensible clarification of its policy toward homosexual immigrants, the U.S. state confronted conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, identifying homosexuals would allow their exclusion&#x2014;still a desired outcome from the department&#x2019;s point of view, as its new policy made clear. On the other hand, the possibility of excluding a large number of Cuban immigrants because of their sexuality posed a practical problem: What would the U.S. government do with a large group of excludable homosexuals who could not be returned to their home country?</p>
		
		<h3>Inconsistent Identification: The State Gaze in Practice</h3>
		<p>In addition to this policy dilemma, practical issues on the ground made the Mariel boatlift a logistical nightmare for the agencies charged with processing immigrants. As the scale of the migration became clear, entry procedures shifted to accommodate the challenges posed by the sudden entrance of tens of thousands of immigrants. In general, upon entry into the United States Mariel Cubans went through a few intense days of processing by federal agencies, local officials, and voluntary agencies. Although the location and intensity of procedures varied according to when a Mariel Cuban entered the country and whether she or he was sent to a resettlement camp, certain elements of processing were applied to the entire population. A description of the typical process for a Mariel entrant arriving in July 1980 (after one hundred thousand Cubans had already entered the United States) provides a sense of what these common procedures were like and reveals the intensity of the bureaucratic gaze to which all entrants were subjected regardless of their status.</p>
		<p>Processing began when Mariel entrants arrived in Key West and were issued provisional I-94 cards. From there, they were sent to Krome North, an INS facility located on the southern outskirts of Dade County. At Krome North, they were welcomed by the facility&#x2019;s Cuban American director, Siro del Castillo, who conveyed &#x201C;to the new arrivals that they [had] left a repressive country and entered a free one.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back27"></a><a href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Mariel Cubans turned in their Cuban passports and I-94s to camp officials and received clothing and other provisions donated by the Red Cross. They were then divided into groups and assigned a tent. Families, single men, and unaccompanied minors were all housed separately.</p>
		<p>The next day, they were bussed to the INS District Office where they filled out a DS 103 form and were fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed by INS and FBI officials. INS officials conducted a biographical history using the G-325A form and administered an I-589 application for asylum for those who expressed a &#x201C;well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Cuba.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back28"></a><a href="#footnote28">28</a></sup> After a separate interview, the FBI decided whether to issue a security clearance. If a Mariel Cuban received the FBI security clearance, she or he was issued a provisional parole with employment authorization valid for sixty days. (Extension of parole required another interview.) They were then interviewed by the voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) charged with facilitating their placement with family or volunteer sponsors and issued a VOLAG registration card. Finally, they were bussed back to Krome North.</p>
		<p>The next day Mariel immigrants were bussed to the Public Health Service (PHS) where their medical histories were taken. In addition they were checked for venereal disease, x-rayed for tuberculosis, and given any necessary vaccinations. Information about active and inactive cases of venereal disease and tuberculosis was sent to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. After health screenings, they were returned to Krome North where VOLAGs assisted in reunifying families, finding volunteer sponsors, or relocating Cubans outside Dade County. All Mariel Cubans needed a sponsor in order to be released from state custody. During the height of the boatlift, the South Florida VOLAGs had only seventy-two hours in which to identify local sponsors. If a sponsor was found within seventy-two hours, the Mariel entrant would be released after the sponsor signed a release form. However, if family sponsors had not been located after seventy-two hours (as was the case with Armando), the entrants were sent to resettlement camps outside Dade County where other VOLAGs would help them find sponsors.<sup><a id="footnote_back29"></a><a href="#footnote29">29</a></sup></p>
		<p>Most Mariel Cubans went through a basic process similar to the one described above during which authorities consistently identified personal characteristics of interest to the state. These included specific aspects of their medical condition, their fingerprints, their self-reporting of criminal history, and so on. In these first days of processing, the state gaze was refracted through several federal agencies including those concerned with immigration status (INS), law enforcement and security (FBI), and public health as well as several voluntary agencies charged with resettlement. While this initial processing was fairly consistent across the Mariel entrant population, processing from this point on varied dramatically, and the route a Mariel entrant followed to sponsorship had a significant impact on the subsequent intensity of the state&#x2019;s fractured gaze. After this initial common processing, Mariel Cubans followed one of three routes: (1) direct resettlement in South Florida for those with available sponsors; (2) review at Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs) for those suspected of having a criminal background; and (3) confinement at a resettlement camp for those without available sponsors. Those Mariel Cubans whose family sponsors were found within the seventy-two-hour window were held in custody for only a few days and never left South Florida. Others were held in state custody for months in processing camps scattered throughout the country, including Fort Chaffee, Arkansas; Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin; and Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Homosexuals and nonhomosexuals followed all three routes. However, the precision and intensity of the U.S. state gaze in relation to homosexuality varied considerably depending on the route.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Route 1: South Florida Resettlements</span></h3>
		<p>The easiest route for entrants was to locate a family or unrelated volunteer sponsor quickly while they were still in the South Florida area. About half of the Mariel entrants were directly placed with such sponsors.<sup><a id="footnote_back30"></a><a href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> Those with family members willing to sponsor them and those who were attractive, nonthreatening candidates for volunteer sponsors were placed more quickly. Less attractive candidates (single men, black men, obvious homosexuals) were more likely to be sent to resettlement camps outside South Florida.</p>
		<p>Given that about half of entering Mariel Cubans were resettled directly out of South Florida, it is likely that many Cuban gays and lesbians were resettled in this way. However, because this group was in state custody for the least amount of time, we have the least information about them. It appears that certain demographic characteristics influenced how quickly VOLAGs found a sponsor for Mariel Cubans. For example, race had a major impact on the likelihood of an entrant finding a sponsor. Only 8 to 10 percent of the Mariel immigrants processed in Miami were black, while approximately 50 percent of those processed through resettlement camps were black or mulatto.<sup><a id="footnote_back31"></a><a href="#footnote31">31</a></sup> Blacks made up 75 percent of those Cubans still awaiting sponsorship in Fort Chaffee after the consolidation of all resettlement camps in October 1980.<sup><a id="footnote_back32"></a><a href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Gender and marital status also played a major role, with single males encountering more difficulties finding a sponsor than families and single females.<sup><a id="footnote_back33"></a><a href="#footnote33">33</a></sup> Although records are lacking, we can hypothesize that the highly gender-transgressive homosexual men within this group had an even harder time finding sponsors. Certainly, this was the case in the resettlement camps where voluntary agencies acknowledged their poor placement record for this population. Judging from the records of the Cuban&#x2013;Haitian Task Force (CHTF), however, the sexuality of successful South Florida resettlement cases did not seem to have concerned the state. There is no evidence that U.S. officials formally identified, enumerated, or differently processed the homosexuals among this population.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Route 2: Federal Correctional Institutions</span></h3>
		<p>Mariel Cubans suspected of having a criminal background were sent to FCIs for further review. Homosexuals who had been arrested in Cuba for crimes related to their homosexuality and who verified as much during INS or FBI questioning would have been processed in this way. Because U.S. authorities were invested in identifying criminals in the Mariel entrant population and because certain expressions of homosexuality were criminalized in Cuba, this portion of the homosexual Mariel population did fall directly under the state&#x2019;s gaze.</p>
		<p>Mariel Cubans who admitted to serving jail time in Cuba were issued a 2-C classification and were sent to an FCI for further investigation. Given the fact that admission of homosexuality to state officials had very recently facilitated exit from Cuba and the belief among some that the United States was less repressive of homosexuals, it is probable that many homosexual Mariel Cubans would not have hidden any previous homosexuality-related incarceration from INS officials. According to Krome North director del Castillo, a distinction was supposed to be made between Cubans who had committed a &#x201C;blood crime&#x201D; and those who had been incarcerated for acts not criminalized in the United States. Only those having committed serious crimes were to be held in the FCIs. However, del Castillo lamented that</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>in practice, political prisoners, those who declared themselves to be prostitutes, deviants, or criminals to obtain permission to leave Cuba, and those who were &#x201C;criminals&#x201D; only by Cuba&#x2019;s standards, as well as others merely suspected of having a criminal background have been given 2-C classification and detained in the FCI.<sup><a id="footnote_back34"></a><a href="#footnote34">34</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p class="extraIndent">A review of information about the Mariel Cubans released from the FCI in Talladega, Alabama, suggests that homosexuals were a significant portion of the 2-C population.<sup><a id="footnote_back35"></a><a href="#footnote35">35</a></sup> A &#x201C;fact sheet&#x201D; explained the procedures that led to the August 1980 &#x201C;release&#x201D; of Mariel Cubans either directly to sponsors or to a resettlement camp. Before recommending release, INS deportation officers extensively interviewed detainees and prepared case files on them that were, in turn, reviewed by an INS attorney who also interviewed each detainee. This file was then reviewed by the INS Commissioner&#x2019;s Office in Washington and finally by Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti. Based on this review process, a total of 215 detainees were released because they had not committed a serious crime, had not committed a crime recently, had already served a sentence for their crime, or were not considered a threat to society.</p>
		<p>To justify their decision to release the detainees, the fact sheet included a &#x201C;sample profile of offenses committed in Cuba.&#x201D; Interestingly, two of the ten sample profiles involve arrests related to homosexuality.<sup><a id="footnote_back36"></a><a href="#footnote36">36</a></sup> While we do not know if this is a &#x201C;representative sample&#x201D;&#x2014;in which case we could deduce that 20 percent of those sent to FCIs had been arrested in Cuba for some crime related to same-sex behavior or identity&#x2014;this memo at least suggests that a significant number of homosexuals were identified as part of the &#x201C;criminal element&#x201D; and segregated upon initial screening.</p>
		<p>The sample profiles include brief descriptions of the detainee to be released including age, date, and description of criminal offense. Al though brief, the descriptions provide considerable insight into the state&#x2019;s concerns about homosexuality. First, authorities were clearly interested in identifying and not releasing pedophiles. Both references to the homosexual detainees attempt to clarify that they are not pedophiles. The first is identified as a thirty-four-year-old who had &#x201C;1971 and 1978 convictions for homosexual acts, never with boys.&#x201D; The other was described as a thirty-one-year-old &#x201C;practicing homosexual&#x201D; with a 1975 &#x201C;conviction for corrupting a minor&#x201D;: &#x201C;police said it involved a 16 year old boy, he says no.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back37"></a><a href="#footnote37">37</a></sup> Second, all profiles include a brief reference to possible sponsors upon release. The thirty-four-year-old &#x201C;has aunts and uncles in the U.S., who may support him&#x201D; and the thirty-one-year-old &#x201C;has a sister in New Jersey, who will help and support him.&#x201D; The presence of willing family sponsors reinforces the assessment that these Cubans would be accepted into society and would not become part of the population stranded in resettlement centers. Finally, the sample profiles and the description of the evaluation procedure confirm one way in which information related to the homosexuality of Mariel Cubans was recorded by the state. These three-line profiles include not only references to particular crimes but also to sexual identity (&#x201C;practicing homosexual&#x201D;), references that demonstrate that the state gaze, at various levels of evaluation, did identify homosexuals and was concerned with how homosexuality would affect their incorporation into U.S. society. This identification, however, was not criteria for attempting to exclude them.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="italic">Route 3: Resettlement Camps</span></h3>
		<p>Although information about the homosexuality of Cubans detained in FCIs was collected, this information was not necessarily public and did not capture the media&#x2019;s attention as did, for instance, criminals convicted of rape and murder. Homosexual Mariel Cubans who were sent to resettlement camps, on the other hand, did attract media attention. The CHTF was aware of media interest and carefully monitored newspaper articles in both national and local publications covering homosexual Mariel Cubans.<sup><a id="footnote_back38"></a><a href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> In the CHTF&#x2019;s final report, they reflected on the impact of this media attention:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>During the summer months, there was media coverage of the presence of homosexuals among the Cuban entrants. The self-segregation of these homosexuals in the resettlement centers gave them a high visibility which facilitated the media coverage.<sup><a id="footnote_back39"></a><a href="#footnote39">39</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>According to the CHTF, &#x201C;widespread publicity&#x201D; increased the difficulty of finding sponsors for the homosexual Mariel Cubans.<sup><a id="footnote_back40"></a><a href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> Federal officials also felt that the visibility of homosexuals contributed to the overall negative perception of the migration. By August 1980, a Harris poll found that 70 to 80 percent of American opinion on Cubans and Haitians was negative, and a Gallup poll reported that 75 percent of Americans believed the Cuban refugee situation was &#x201C;bad for our country.&#x201D; Responding to these polls in a Department of State memo, CHTF director of public affairs Arthur P. Brill identified &#x201C;reasons for negative public opinion,&#x201D; including &#x201C;negative performances by Cubans&#x201D;:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Last, but certainly not least, is the wide media attention given to the bad performers. The hijackers, rioters, criminals, malcontents, homosexuals, and prostitutes have received the limelight. . . . As a result, the malperformers are giving the impression to the American people that the entrants are not grateful.<sup><a id="footnote_back41"></a><a href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>To challenge this negative impression, the federal government denied any systematic knowledge or identification of homosexual immigrants in the camps. However, because obvious homosexuality and gender transgression did impede resettlement, homosexuality had to be taken into account to facilitate the processing of homosexual Cubans. Therefore authorities simultaneously claimed to not see homosexuals in order to deny their presence to the media and actively sought to identify this population in order to move them out of the media spotlight.</p>
		<p>The resettlement camp population became the primary focus of media debates about homosexual Mariel Cubans for several reasons. First, they were held in state custody for longer than those resettled directly from South Florida. Second, obvious gays or gender-transgressive male homosexuals were generally segregated or self-segregated within the camps and were therefore more visible to visitors and the press. Finally, obvious gays were more likely to be confined in the resettlement camps for longer periods of time than less visible homosexuals&#x2014;and, in turn, more likely to be included in the categories difficult-to-place Cubans or &#x201C;special cases.&#x201D;</p>
		<p>That homosexuals were a recognized category within the resettlement population was not a secret to camp residents, camp officers, or the media. For example, a newsletter produced by camp residents and staff at Fort Chaffee contained two sections on health advice related to venereal disease and addressed to homosexual men (&#x201C;compa&#xf1;ero gay&#x201D;) and women (&#x201C;amiga homosexual&#x201D;) at the camp.<sup><a id="footnote_back42"></a><a href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Despite official denials, camp officials were clearly aware of the homosexual population. In a State Department memo in response to direct questions about the homosexual population, Senior Civilian Coordinator Donald Whitteaker described the presence of &#x201C;two different types of homosexuals at Fort Chaffee, admitted and closet.&#x201D; According to Whitteaker, the homosexuals were &#x201C;consenting adults and segregated by their design. Lifestyle is casual and open.&#x201D; Whitteaker also responded to concerns about unaccompanied minors by acknowledging that &#x201C;there may be some young males or females 18 to 20 years of age that are victims of male and female homosexuals and prostitutes. However, as these are identified, action is taken to protect them by segregating them or moving them to a new area.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back43"></a><a href="#footnote43">43</a></sup> This detailed response indicates a high level of attention to the homosexual population on the part of government authorities despite official denials.</p>
		<p>Before the gay Mariel story broke in the national media, local newspapers were asking camp workers about the presence of homosexuals as a distinct group within the camps. For example, one article from a newspaper from an area outside Fort Indiantown Gap camp published an article on Cuban gays. The photograph illustrating this article featured four gender-transgressive men identified in the caption as &#x201C;admitted Cuban homosexuals.&#x201D; Quoted officials openly discussed male homosexuals at the camp, consistently referring to them as &#x201C;the faggots.&#x201D; Justifying the need to segregate homosexuals in a separate area, camp workers also discussed violence between homosexuals and non-homosexuals. In reference to an incident in which a gay man defended himself by knocking out another man with the lid of a garbage can, a soldier explained: &#x201C;They are faggots but they have man muscles.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back44"></a><a href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> In addition to local newspapers, the gay press (including the <span class="italic">Sentinel, </span>the <span class="italic">Blade, </span>and the <span class="italic">Advocate</span>) reported on the gay Mariel story.<sup><a id="footnote_back45"></a><a href="#footnote45">45</a></sup></p>

		<p class="extraIndent">Editors and reporters from the national mainstream press also knew about the gay population early on. In a <span class="italic">Columbia Journalism Review </span>article, Michael Massing quotes editors and reporters from <span class="italic">Newsday,</span> the <span class="italic">New York Times, </span>and the <span class="italic">Boston Globe </span>who were clearly aware of the gay presence among Mariel migrants, including the presence of segregated homosexual barracks in resettlement camps; some had observed same-sex couples walking hand in hand at the camps. Until July 7, 1980, however, the national mainstream media avoided the topic of gay men among the Mariel entrants, citing the &#x201C;unavailability of reliable data&#x201D; as the reason for this omission.<sup><a id="footnote_back46"></a><a href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> The theme of unreliable data would emerge again and again as state officials attempted to silence the gay Mariel story.</p>

    <h3><span class="italic">Homosexuality and Gender Transgression in Resettlement Camps: What Happens When Jos&#xE9; Is Wearing a Dress?</span></h3>
		<p>Although an overall demographic picture identifying the sexuality of Mariel Cubans was not available, public health, mental health, and medical professionals working with and for the state constructed their own version of reliable scientific data. These medical professionals identified the presence of homosexuals as a topic of interest and responded to state concerns about the population. Medical professionals were less concerned with the public relations implications of identifying particular populations. As they identified homosexuality as a potential social problem related to issues of public health, they turned their well-honed gaze on this captive population.<sup><a id="footnote_back47"></a><a href="#footnote47">47</a></sup></p>
		<p>For example, medical adviser Dr. Harold Ginzburg provided an assessment of Mariel Cubans that was subsequently summarized in a memo from Bill Schroeder to Nick Nichols. The physician, working with mental health services, constructed three categories of homosexuals. The first category included Cubans who claimed to be homosexual in order to leave Cuba and did not engage in homosexual activity in the camps. The second category, &#x201C;situational homosexuals,&#x201D; were &#x201C;heterosexuals, who, while imprisoned, practiced homosexuality, but once released, reverted once again to heterosexuality.&#x201D; The third category he labeled &#x201C;gays.&#x201D; Gays were &#x201C;naturally inclined to homosexuality,&#x201D; tended to &#x201C;keep to themselves,&#x201D; and posed &#x201C;no threat to society.&#x201D; Although not posing an active threat themselves, Ginzburg expressed concern that &#x201C;gays&#x201D; were often victims of violence. He was especially concerned with homosexual rape and explained that &#x201C;in some instances this occurs because some of the men are &#x2018;teasers&#x2019; and, in the eyes of the aggressor, warranted the attack. Some rapes occur between two gays in circumstances where they are fighting due to a separation.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back48"></a><a href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></p>
		<p>A controversial report cowritten by a physician and a public health specialist emphasized the disruptive presence of homosexuals in one resettlement camp. The August 1980 &#x201C;Report on Status of Cuban Refugees at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin&#x201D; by Rachel M. Schwartz and Peter D. Kramer painted a grim picture of camp life that highlighted violence and the prevalence of criminals who were not readily identifiable as such. Schwartz and Kramer repeatedly asserted that homosexuals were an &#x201C;excludable category, by act of Congress&#x201D; even though they were not being moved to exclusion hearings.<sup><a id="footnote_back49"></a><a href="#footnote49">49</a></sup> Like Ginzburg, they expressed concern for violence against homosexuals, stating that &#x201C;sexual abuse of homosexuals by heterosexuals is not uncommon, and apparently accounts for a fair amount of violence.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back50"></a><a href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> According to them, &#x201C;jealousy over the homosexual love affairs&#x201D; led to stabbings, and &#x201C;apparently frequent&#x201D; homosexual rape: &#x201C;at least it [was] commented on frequently in conversation and [was] a constant fear of weaker homosexual youths.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back51"></a><a href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> They also describe homosexual prostitution in the camps, identifying a &#x201C;male whorehouse&#x201D; and a &#x201C;homosexual whorehouse.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back52"></a><a href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></p>
		<p>In a review of the Kramer Report, Ginzburg refuted some of their allegations. For example, while he acknowledged the occurrence of homosexual rape, Ginzburg stated that he was unaware of the &#x201C;statistics&#x201D; Schwartz and Kramer had used to indicate that minors were unaccounted for and that led them to suggest that &#x201C;these children (teenagers) are hidden in the men&#x2019;s barracks, where they are used sexually by or otherwise paired with adults.&#x201D; Ginzburg did agree that homosexual men were &#x201C;safer&#x201D; in the family compound and that sexual activity was occurring &#x201C;between consenting men.&#x201D; As a rejoinder to the Kramer Report&#x2019;s sensationalist language, Ginzburg added, &#x201C;homosexual activities are not criminal offenses in many states in which they involve consenting adults.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back53"></a><a href="#footnote53">53</a></sup> The tension between Schwartz and Kramer and Ginzburg reminds us that the medical gaze itself was fractured and provided, at best, overlapping and often contradictory representations of Mariel homosexuals.</p>
		<p>In addition to identifying the homosexual population, the medical gaze also offered a glimpse of the cultural practices that developed in the camps&#x2014;a culture that federal bureaucrats preferred to ignore or downplay. For example, Schwartz and Kramer gesture toward the role of gender transgression and cross-dressing in the camps:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Walking around the camp one is likely to encounter attractive young women made-up and dressed in colorful clothing. On careful inspection, however, these women are men. Many of the homosexuals have migrated to the family compound because they feel it is safer. They have created their own subculture.<sup><a id="footnote_back54"></a><a href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>For homosexual men who had long suffered the consequences of being visibly gay in Castro&#x2019;s Cuba, the Mariel boatlift provided an opening in which the gender transgression performed in the face of state oppression became a ticket out of the country. They had strategically flaunted. Many believed they were coming to a country of gay freedom. Inside and outside the camps, many embraced the notion that they were going to hide no longer. Gender transgression was one culturally resonant way in which a subpopulation of men who had sex with men and identified as homosexual expressed that identity.</p>
		<p>Viewed in this way, the gender transgression of the gay Marielitos enacted both political resistance and community formation. However, this visible behavior posed an obstacle to traditional resettlement. For example, David Lewis, a representative of the United States Catholic Conference, explained on <span class="italic">The MacNeil/Lehrer Report </span>on September 19, 1980:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>We have a number of individuals at Chaffee whose lifestyles is obviously something that we must be very honest [about] with our sponsors. . . . And if we pick up some facets of their personality which are possibly going to be a surprise to the sponsor, if Jos&#xE9;, as it turns out, is in fact wearing a dress, it&#x2019;s obviously very important that we discuss this issue with the sponsor.<sup><a id="footnote_back55"></a><a href="#footnote55">55</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>As Lewis&#x2019;s comment suggests, the voluntary agencies traditionally involved with resettling refugees, many of them religious organizations, were not necessarily well-suited to finding sponsors for a dress-wearing Jos&#xE9;. Thus the situation continued to intensify. As the resettlement camp VOLAGs found sponsors for more and more Mariel Cubans, the concentration of &#x201C;problem cases&#x201D; or &#x201C;hard-to-place&#x201D; populations increased in the camps, as did their media visibility.</p>
		<p>As the deviance of the Mariel Cuban population increasingly became the subject of sensationalist media stories, the state had an interest in dispersing the spectacle of visible, gender-transgressive homosexuals concentrated in state custody. To move the <span class="italic">locas </span>out of the media spotlight and facilitate their sponsorship, state and federal agencies needed to identify the gay population. In other words, the state gaze needed to see the gender-transgressive homosexuals in the resettlement camps to get them away from the media gaze. However, if the state formally recognized their homosexuality, they could be subject to exclusion hearings based on INS homosexual exclusion policies. To navigate these contradictions, the authorities needed to process gender-transgressive homosexuals without officially identifying them as homosexuals.</p>
		
		<h3>Managing Public Relations:  The U.S. Media and the Gay Mariel Story</h3>
		<p>On July 7, 1980, the <span class="italic">Washington Post </span>reporter Warren Brown published a story about gay Mariel Cubans after an anonymous government source leaked that twenty thousand homosexuals remained in the camps.<sup><a id="footnote_back56"></a><a href="#footnote56">56</a></sup> In addition to reporting that half of the Cubans awaiting resettlement were gay, Brown also asserted that the federal government was working with national gay and lesbian organizations to assist in resettling the remaining gay Cubans. The story was picked up by the newswire and reprinted as the <span class="italic">Miami Herald</span>&#x2019;s lead front-page story under the headline &#x201C;20,000 Gay Refugees Await Sponsors.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back57"></a><a href="#footnote57">57</a></sup> Brown&#x2019;s story focused on the resettlement camp population, and so did the debates that ensued.</p>
		<p>The U.S. government was already aware of the homosexual population in part because of the visibility of the practices of gay male Marielitos. However, once Brown broke the &#x201C;gay Mariel story,&#x201D; the federal government was forced to address the issue officially. The CHTF responded by taking a series of official positions in response to Brown&#x2019;s article. These were as follows: (1) they did not identify homosexuals in the Mariel population; (2) they did not know how many homosexuals there were; (3) they did not involuntarily segregate homosexuals in resettlement camps; and (4) they did not work with gay organizations to resettle gay Marielitos.<sup><a id="footnote_back58"></a><a href="#footnote58">58</a></sup></p>
		<p>The first position was articulated in a July 7, 1980, FEMA memo issued in direct response to the <span class="italic">Washington Post </span>article. In the memo, FEMA director John W. Macy asserted: &#x201C;We have made no attempt to identify or classify these individuals at the reception and processing centers.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back59"></a><a href="#footnote59">59</a></sup> Two press guidance sheets issued in September reinforced this position, clarifying that &#x201C;sexual preference in individual Cubans was not asked during INS processing.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back60"></a><a href="#footnote60">60</a></sup> The CHTF&#x2019;s final report also reiterates that the &#x201C;INS [did] not ask&#x201D; Mariel Cubans if they were homosexual.<sup><a id="footnote_back61"></a><a href="#footnote61">61</a></sup></p>
		<p>While there is no evidence that a definitive, systematic count of homosexuals in the entire Mariel population was ever made, sources suggest that at least some subgroups of the population were officially asked about their sexuality. At the same time, there seem to have been different processes for identifying gay populations at each resettlement camp and processing center. Within the camps, too, not all men who self-identified as gay identified themselves as such to government officials.</p>
		<p>In point of fact, evidence suggests that much of the information about the homosexuality of Mariel Cubans was gathered by mental health professionals or voluntary agencies rather than by the INS. For example, del Castillo acknowledged that Mariel Cubans at the camps were asked about their sexuality by camp psychiatrists and psychologists assisting in their relocation.<sup><a id="footnote_back62"></a><a href="#footnote62">62</a></sup> Since del Castillo&#x2019;s statement focuses on mental health professionals working with VOLAGs, his assertion does not directly contradict the CHTF&#x2019;s public position.</p>
		<p>Other sources, however, indicate that the INS was identifying homosexual as possibly excludable aliens. For example, in a discussion of the population being held at Fort McCoy, Schwartz and Kramer explained that &#x201C;early on&#x201D; in the migration, &#x201C;homosexuals (an excludable category, by act of Congress)&#x201D; were being identified as &#x201C;disturbed&#x201D; by &#x201C;lay interviewers&#x201D; and referred for mental health interviews. However, &#x201C;it was soon decided not to move for exclusion hearings for homosexuality alone. (Hearings are &#x2018;deferred&#x2019;).&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back63"></a><a href="#footnote63">63</a></sup> Schwartz and Kramer further suggested that the identification of homosexuals happened during INS interviews. Seamlessly conflating &#x201C;criminals&#x201D; with &#x201C;homosexuals,&#x201D; they criticize the federal government&#x2019;s inability to &#x201C;sort&#x201D; Mariel Cubans properly:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>In reality much of the information learned about the population did not result in adequate sorting of people. For example despite the rigorous nature of the INS interview numerous criminal types were admitted to the general population of single men. Homosexuality, while initially an excludable category, has been placed in abeyance, but known homosexuals were placed with single male heterosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back64"></a><a href="#footnote64">64</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p class="extraIndent">Schwartz and Kramer&#x2019;s assertion that the INS asked Mariel Cubans about their sexuality is substantiated by other sources. As mentioned previously, Ginzburg&#x2019;s report had noted that some Cubans claimed to be homosexual in order to leave Cuba and that &#x201C;when they arrived in the US they informed INS as such. In nearly all of these instances, their behaviour verified their claim.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back65"></a><a href="#footnote65">65</a></sup> An <span class="italic">Advocate </span>writer quoted by Allen Young reported that at Fort Indiantown Gap, the &#x201C;INS [had] been asking gay Cubans pointed questions about their sex lives and relationships.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back66"></a><a href="#footnote66">66</a></sup> In regard to processing at Fort Walton Beach, one of Young&#x2019;s respondents recalled that</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>while being processed by American authorities, the more obvious gays in the camp were questioned as to whether they were homosexual. Some men went to these interviews wearing makeup or female clothing. Their being gay was not an obstacle to the processing, and in fact they were told that if they had any problems (from straight Cubans) the authorities would intervene.<sup><a id="footnote_back67"></a><a href="#footnote67">67</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p class="extraIndent">In addition to reports showing that the INS had asked some Cubans about their sexuality, federal documents also indicate that the agency had identified &#x201C;homosexuals&#x201D; or &#x201C;gays&#x201D; as a significant subgroup within the Mariel population that required special attention. Sometimes the discussion of homosexual migrants was subsumed under umbrella categories such as &#x201C;undesirables,&#x201D; &#x201C;problem populations,&#x201D; or &#x201C;hard to place&#x201D; populations. Sometimes these umbrella categories did not explicitly include homosexuals; other times they did. For example, in a July 22, 1980, State Department memo, CHTF director Thorne discussed the &#x201C;problem&#x201D; of &#x201C;aliens with troubled backgrounds,&#x201D; a category that included those with a &#x201C;high probability that they could not adjust to our society immediately and could cause serious problems for their sponsors and for their sponsors&#x2019; local communities.&#x201D; To clarify which groups were included in this category he specified:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Examples of those troubled backgrounds are homosexuals, rebellious minors, people who have spent considerable time in prison but who would not be judged as felons in our society, borderline mentally disturbed persons, prostitutes.<sup><a id="footnote_back68"></a><a href="#footnote68">68</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>A CHTF report written toward the end of the boatlift specifically identifies &#x201C;Gays&#x201D; as one of four &#x201C;problem populations&#x201D; and devotes an entire section to discussion of this group.<sup><a id="footnote_back69"></a><a href="#footnote69">69</a></sup></p>
		<p>A range of evidence, therefore, refutes the assertion that the federal government, including the INS, did not question Mariel entrants about homosexuality or identify homosexuals. While a systematic account of the sexuality of all entering Mariel Cubans was probably never taken, the INS and others working in conjunction with federal agencies did ask some questions about their sexuality. In addition, homosexuals as a group were identified as a subpopulation that presented particular challenges. Although some documents subsume homosexuals under nonspecific umbrella categories like &#x201C;problem populations,&#x201D; other documents clearly include &#x201C;gays,&#x201D; homosexuals, and/or gender-transgressive males in these broadly construed categories.</p>
		<p>In response to Brown&#x2019;s estimate that twenty thousand gay Cubans awaited resettlement, the federal government made a second assertion: it did not know how many homosexuals there were among the camp population, and when forced to estimate it could only guess. A September press guidance sheet, for example, simply asserts that there was &#x201C;no exact count&#x201D; of the number of homosexuals in the camps.<sup><a id="footnote_back70"></a><a href="#footnote70">70</a></sup> The federal government asked officials to come up with a more realistic estimate of the number of homosexuals awaiting resettlement. In an internal memo, FEMA director Macy replied: &#x201C;We have surveyed the camps and obtained for the coordinators their &#x2018;out of the sky&#x2019; estimate that the number ranges from <span class="italic">200 </span>to <span class="italic">500 </span>at each camp and certainly will not exceed more than <span class="italic">1,750 </span>for all four facilities.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back71"></a><a href="#footnote71">71</a></sup> Official estimates cited in media retractions were usually quite low, ranging from &#x201C;only a few&#x201D; to Macy&#x2019;s 1,750 to the comparatively high figure of 6,800.<sup><a id="footnote_back72"></a><a href="#footnote72">72</a></sup> From this point on, government figures referred to both the number of homosexuals among the population awaiting resettlement and the number of homosexuals among the entire Mariel entrant population. Federal officials estimated that between 1,000 and 2,500 homosexual Cubans had entered as part of the entire Mariel population.<sup><a id="footnote_back73"></a><a href="#footnote73">73</a></sup> In other words, some officials believed that fewer homosexuals had entered as part of the whole migration (1,000) than were awaiting resettlement (1,750), clearly a mathematical impossibility. Other government sources, however, indicate a larger population. In a draft of a document analyzing the role of the Department of Health and Human Services in the consolidation of unsettled Mariel Cubans into one resettlement camp, it is noted that &#x201C;5000&#x2013;8000 (probably 10,000) un-sponsored adults&#x201D; remained at the camps, adding that of these, &#x201C;a large share are homosexual; thus, sponsors are difficult to find.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back74"></a><a href="#footnote74">74</a></sup></p>
		<p>Regardless of the size of the homosexual population, it is clear that the federal government kept track of homosexual Mariel Cubans. Although some of the counts were taken in response to Brown&#x2019;s article, internal documents also included estimates of homosexuals awaiting resettlement as solicited by the federal government for other purposes. For example, a document titled &#x201C;Questions on Consolidation: Asked by the Cuban Haitian Task Force, Washington&#x201D; requested a count of people with &#x201C;sexual preference (different)&#x201D; by August 2, 1980.<sup><a id="footnote_back75"></a><a href="#footnote75">75</a></sup> Spreadsheets enumerating different classes of Mariel Cubans were compiled by different entities involved in resettlement, including the Department of State. A handwritten document found in the CHTF director&#x2019;s files on consolidation to Fort Chaffee (marked &#x201C;not for release, for internal use only&#x201D;) provided estimates of different groups remaining at each of the resettlement camps, including 260 homosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back76"></a><a href="#footnote76">76</a></sup> Another spreadsheet, this time attached to a Department of State memo, outlined &#x201C;resettlement coordination&#x201D; and included preliminary estimates of &#x201C;classes&#x201D; of detainees, including male and female homosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back77"></a><a href="#footnote77">77</a></sup> These estimates were produced by and for administrators who needed data to solve the problem posed by hard-to-place populations because they were managing the resettlement process.</p>
		<p>These figures are not presented here as accurate counts of the homosexual population. However, they do reveal the state&#x2019;s intent to identify certain homosexuals, usually to facilitate their sponsorship. Federal documents also suggest who the state gaze saw as homosexual. One report, written after consolidation of the population awaiting sponsorship at Fort Chaffee, explained that the homosexuals &#x201C;remaining in the camp are more difficult to place due to personal characteristics.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back78"></a><a href="#footnote78">78</a></sup> A September 1980 press guidance sheet hinted at what these personal characteristics might be. After clarifying that the INS did not ask about &#x201C;sexual preference,&#x201D; the press guidance went on to provide an estimate of homosexuals at the camps:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>Based on the number of males affecting female grooming and dressing standards in the camp, it&#x2019;s safe to say that the gay community within the Cuban entrant population reflects the same percentage found in any American community of similar size.<sup><a id="footnote_back79"></a><a href="#footnote79">79</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The conflation of homosexuality with gender transgression is telling. First, it reflects an assumption that all male homosexuals &#x201C;affect[ed] female grooming.&#x201D; Second, it reflects the prevalence of gender transgression among homosexuals in the camp and the identification of this style with a subculture. Finally, it reflects the selectivity of the state gaze that saw only gender-transgressive homosexual men as gay. This is most likely the case because it was gender-transgressive males&#x2014;Jos&#xE9; wearing a dress&#x2014;who posed the most significant challenges to VOLAGs facilitating resettlement, and it was this population that the state really needed to see, if only in order to make it disappear.</p>
		<p>The third assertion made by the federal government in response to Brown&#x2019;s article was that it did not segregate homosexuals in resettlement camps: the homosexuals segregated themselves. The September press guidance sheet stated: &#x201C;We do not segregate homosexuals statistically or physically within the reception centers. In the latter, we do know that homosexuals have managed to segregate themselves within some centers. But that is of their choosing, not our design.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back80"></a><a href="#footnote80">80</a></sup> At least in some of the camps, homosexual men and lesbians were kept in separate sections. In Fort Chaffee, for example, there were two barracks (one hundred men each) &#x201C;given over to the homosexuals.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back81"></a><a href="#footnote81">81</a></sup> Ernie Acosta reports that at Fort Indiantown Gap the &#x201C;openly gay refugees&#x201D; whom he also describes as &#x201C;campy, flamboyant types who bore the brunt of Castro&#x2019;s persecution&#x201D; were placed in barracks &#x201C;in the middle of the camp&#x2019;s single men&#x2019;s area . . . surrounded by heterosexual refugees who view[ed] the gays with open hostility.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back82"></a><a href="#footnote82">82</a></sup></p>
		<p>In most camps, the segregation appears to have been voluntarily designed by gay Cubans themselves for protection, as the press guidance sheet asserts. However, imposed segregation was recommended at Fort Chaffee by several government sources.<sup><a id="footnote_back83"></a><a href="#footnote83">83</a></sup> Also, the Fort Indian-town Gap After Action Report indicates that as early as May 1980, authorities &#x201C;began to isolate the homosexuals in Area 3.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back84"></a><a href="#footnote84">84</a></sup> A July 6, 1980, article in the <span class="italic">Lebanon Sunday Pennsylvanian </span>confirms that this segregation was imposed because the residents of areas three and four were &#x201C;considered special by base officials. Special enough to separate them from the rest of the Cuban males and keep them together. They are the homosexuals.&#x201D; Camp officials added that segregation was necessary because of the frequent eruption of violence between homosexuals and single heterosexual men.<sup><a id="footnote_back85"></a><a href="#footnote85">85</a></sup> Therefore, although homosexuals themselves did orchestrate their segregation in many cases, camps officials followed their lead and imposed segregation in other cases.</p>
		<p>The final assertion made by the federal government&#x2019;s CHTF was that it was not working with gay organizations to resettle gay Cubans. A press guidance sheet dated July 7, 1980 (the very day the <span class="italic">Washington Post </span>story ran), states that the U.S. government had not formally requested the assistance of the Metropolitan Community Church or other gay organizations in resettling the refugees and that the resettlement process was being handled by VOLAGs.<sup><a id="footnote_back86"></a><a href="#footnote86">86</a></sup> The official position, therefore, was that the federal government did not work with gay agencies, but that the VOLAGs who handled the resettlement sometimes, in effect, subcontracted such agencies. In a Department of State memo, Shepard C. Lowman informed Victor Palmieri, ambassador-at-large and U.S. coordinator for refugee affairs, as early as July 7, 1980, of the need for special attention regarding the resettlement of homosexual migrants. Lowman recommended &#x201C;Premium R&#x26;P grants for hardcore resettlement cases.&#x201D; To facilitate the grants and clarify who would be eligible, &#x201C;various categories of special cases would have to be defined with some precision, including aged, drug cases, alcoholism, severe physical handicapped, mental retardation, homosexuality.&#x201D; Next to this recommendation is a handwritten &#x201C;No.&#x201D; Because the memo was dated the same day as the <span class="italic">Post </span>article, it is possible that the denial of this request was related to Brown&#x2019;s claims, for this type of targeted funding would only have drawn more media attention to the homosexual Cubans.</p>
		<p>By July 1980, gay organizations had already been working diligently to resettle gay Cubans. Most prominent among these was the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC), which by July had established a Lesbian/Gay Cuban Task Force to aid Cuban refugees who were not being placed by existing resettlement agencies because of their homosexuality.<sup><a id="footnote_back87"></a><a href="#footnote87">87</a></sup> During the resettlement period, MCC churches raised $40,000 to assist gay Mariel Cubans.<sup><a id="footnote_back88"></a><a href="#footnote88">88</a></sup> According to their estimates, they found housing for over ten thousand people.</p>
		<p>The MCC did work through Church World Services, in cooperation with American Baptist Churches; therefore, the CHTF could claim that they were not directly working with gay organizations.<sup><a id="footnote_back89"></a><a href="#footnote89">89</a></sup> However, the federal government was clearly aware that gay organizations were helping in the resettlement effort. July CHTF staff meeting minutes indicate that one of the VOLAGs, Church World Services, had &#x201C;agreed to prioritize homosexuals out of Eglin and then out of other camps.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back90"></a><a href="#footnote90">90</a></sup> In a September 26, 1980, State Department memo, Barbara Lawson also indicated that the federal government and the CHTF were directly involved in resettling gay immigrants. In a memo to CHTF director Christian Holmes, Lawson referred to the tensions in the camps:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>The general Cuban population [in the camps] wanted their quick removal, but resented any effort to generate sponsorship to make this possible. In any event, the Metropolitan Gay Church, through Church World Service, has been working with the Task Force to identify sponsors and resettle the homosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back91"></a><a href="#footnote91">91</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>A Department of Health and Human Services memo on consolidating the Mariel migrants at Fort Chaffee further elaborated the government&#x2019;s collaboration with MCC in resettlement:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>MCC has already resettled close to 2000 gay entrants working through the VOLAGS, and has submitted a proposal to the CHTF to resettle the remaining gay entrants at Fort Chaffee. MCC provides the gamut of services including counseling, orientation, job referral, housing assistance, etc., primarily in gay communities in the US.<sup><a id="footnote_back92"></a><a href="#footnote92">92</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p class="extraIndent">By February 1981, a Department of Health and Human Services spreadsheet indicated that the federal government was negotiating not only with the MCC but also with BACAR, the National Gay Rights Coalition, and &#x201C;Gays&#x201D; to facilitate the &#x201C;special placements&#x201D; of Mariel Cubans awaiting resettlement.<sup><a id="footnote_back93"></a><a href="#footnote93">93</a></sup> An April 1981 Department of Health and Human Services memo confirmed that the MCC had received a resettlement grant to place 150 gay people in transitional environments (halfway houses) in San Francisco, Illinois, and Baltimore. The <span class="italic">Christian Century </span>reported that the grant was for $307,500.<sup><a id="footnote_back94"></a><a href="#footnote94">94</a></sup> According to Frank Zerilli, &#x201C;Many [Mariel gays] did not last long with our membership, but quickly found jobs, went to Miami or did other things.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back95"></a><a href="#footnote95">95</a></sup></p>
		<p>A close examination of both the state&#x2019;s official press positions on gay Mariel Cubans and evidence found in internal records of federal agencies reveals (perhaps expected) contradictions. While the CHTF claimed that it did not identify, count, or segregate homosexuals and that it was not working with gay organizations, federal authorities did, albeit inconsistently, identify, count, and segregate homosexuals, and they did end up working with and partly funding gay agencies to resettle the Mariel Cubans. Clearly, the CHTF was maintaining a false front in the face of considerable contradictory evidence.</p>
		<p>In the midst of the smoke-and-mirrors effect produced by the state&#x2019;s refracted gaze, it was still unclear whether homosexual Cubans who had been identified by the state in informal and formal ways were going to be allowed to stabilize their status (shifting from parolees to permanent residents) or whether they were going to be excluded formally as a group. As homosexual exclusion policy stood after its 1980 clarification, anyone who made two consecutive &#x201C;unsolicited and unambiguous&#x201D; declarations of homosexuality could be excluded. Because of this, gay and lesbian organizations working with the Cuban entrants demanded policy clarification from the INS and began to counsel gay men to be careful what they said to immigration authorities.</p>
		<p>Partly in response to this pressure from gay and lesbian organizations, the INS clarified its position on gay Mariel Cubans five years later. In 1985, the INS explained that gay or lesbian refugees who entered as part of Mariel and were identified as gay or lesbian would &#x201C;not be excluded from the U.S. based on that information alone.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back96"></a><a href="#footnote96">96</a></sup> In a letter to representatives of two gay and lesbian organizations, INS deputy assistant commissioner R. Michael Miller clarifies:</p>
		
		<div class="blockquote">
		<p>This service realizes that due to a variety of reasons, some &#x201C;Marielitos&#x201D; were erroneously identified as being homosexual during initial interviews that occurred shortly after their arrival in the United States.</p>
		<p>Information contained in Service records, although given consideration, will not be the sole basis to deny an alien&#x2019;s application for adjustment of status, nor will extraneous documents or statements made by other persons. No alien will be considered ineligible for adjustment of status on the basis of sexual preference unless he/she makes or has made for the record an unequivocable, unambiguous declaration that he/she is a homosexual.<sup><a id="footnote_back97"></a><a href="#footnote97">97</a></sup></p>
		</div>
		
		<p>This letter reasserts the September 1980 policy that only an &#x201C;unequivocable and unambiguous declaration&#x201D; of homosexuality would be grounds for possible exclusion. The letter also seems to suggest that a statement such as &#x201C;I am a homosexual&#x201D; made upon entering the United States was not to be interpreted as an &#x201C;unequivocable, and unambiguous declaration&#x201D; because &#x201C;some &#x2018;Marielitos&#x2019; were erroneously identified as being homosexual.&#x201D;</p>
		
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>When Armando presented himself to Cuban police officials, he wanted to be sure that the state gaze would see him as an obvious, flamboyant, effeminate homosexual. To be identified as <span class="italic">escoria </span>during that brief moment was a way out of the country and, to his young eyes, a ticket to a land of freedom and opportunity.</p>
		<p>In Cuba, the state gaze was relatively consistent during this moment. Cuban authorities had a vested interest in identifying an already stigmatized group, obvious homosexuals, to facilitate their expulsion from the country. The state gaze saw men who were gender transgressive, ostentatious, and ostensibly passive. Homosexual men also understood objectionable manifestations of their sexuality and exaggerated these characteristics for the police. To say that the Cuban state gaze was consistent is not to say that it was necessarily precise, for during Mariel, people who had not previously identified as homosexual claimed to be homosexual in order to leave the country. Others who did understand themselves to be homosexual were not allowed to leave the country because they were not identified by police as homosexual (or as homosexual enough) or because other factors restricted their departure, as they nearly did in the case of Arenas.</p>
		<p>In the United States, the state gaze was neither consistent nor precise. Facing competing imperatives to welcome victims of communism while excluding homosexuals, the U.S. state carefully crafted policy clarifications that allowed it to welcome Mariel Cubans (although not with the same enthusiasm as previous cohorts) and to maintain a homosexual exclusion policy (while allowing for plausible deniability). The state thus had an interest in not seeing or identifying homosexual entrants, since, given the tenor of the relationship between Cuba and United States, returning Cubans to Cuba was an unlikely scenario. Detaining Mariel homosexuals indefinitely, as the United States tried to do with Mariel entrants unequivocally identified as criminals, was also an expensive and unattractive option. Despite these disincentives, even authorities who pretended not to see the homosexuals were actively engaged in the politics of homosexual visibility precisely because administrative needs required the identification of those homosexuals who disrupted camp life or posed a challenge to traditional resettlement.</p>
		<p>In addition to these inconsistent policies, state identification of homosexual entrants was imprecise. Not all men who thought of themselves as homosexuals were visibly identifiable as gay, nor did they all verbally declare their homosexuality to state officials. When the state recognized the need to identify homosexuals (to facilitate their re-settlement), it acknowledged primarily gender-transgressive, obvious gays. As various federal officials attempted to count this population, the imprecision of the gaze was further revealed. It is impossible to make the different government estimates add up because contradictory figures block any attempt at a coherent summation. We simply do not know how many gay men and lesbians arrived as part of the Mariel boatlift. Moreover, U.S. government estimates focused on the Mariel migrants who remained in camps, in effect ignoring the existence of other gay men and women who had already joined family members. While there might have been some data about the number of people who admitted being homosexuals to the INS or the number who were segregated in the camps, these figures represented only a portion of gay Marielitos because they excluded those who preferred to lie about their sexuality or who would not have been classified as gay based solely on their appearance. The practical impossibility of quantifying the gay Mariel migration made it easier to mute this issue in the mainstream media. By drawing attention to quantitative failures, federal authorities helped keep the potentially explosive story of gay Mariel shrouded in uncertainty.</p>
		<p>Although inconsistent and imprecise, the federal government did at some levels identify individual homosexual entrants as well as the size of the homosexual subpopulation. And the power of state identification practices lies not in their precision. Rather, as Luibh&#xE9;id has convincingly argued, identification and processing by the U.S. immigration service constructed &#x201C;the very sexual categories and identities&#x201D; it sought to regulate.<sup><a id="footnote_back98"></a><a href="#footnote98">98</a></sup> Discussing the mid-twentieth century, Margot Canaday argues that the state did not simply respond to a visible and preconstituted homosexual, but rather the federal state &#x201C;also <span class="italic">constituted </span>homosexuality.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back99"></a><a href="#footnote99">99</a></sup> Canaday further elaborates: &#x201C;Homosexuality was never something like tuberculosis: a problem to be discovered by the state and then simply reacted to. Homosexuality was much more like a race: a certain set of rules produced out of the state&#x2019;s own murky encounter with difference.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back100"></a><a href="#footnote100">100</a></sup> In the case of Mariel entrants, the state situated immigrants &#x201C;within larger relations of power to which they remained subjected after entry.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back101"></a><a href="#footnote101">101</a></sup> The identification process thus constructs subject categories to facilitate the control of populations. The processing of immigrants with regard to sexuality provided Marielitos with their first socialization into U.S. sexual categories and identities. Whereas in Cuba the distinction between active and passive homosexuality was key (passive homosexuals were the real homosexuals and the corrupting force), it is unlikely that U.S. authorities adopted this distinction. However, by the end of the resettlement process, government officials were actively trying to ascertain how many homosexuals remained at the camps, basing their estimates not on identity or same-sex behavior per se but on gender-transgressive expressions that impeded resettlement. Ironically, although the Cuban and U.S. state gazes were differently grounded, in the end, both targeted the same population&#x2014;gender-transgressive, &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; gay men.</p>
		<p>Despite inconsistencies and imprecision, the state&#x2019;s fractured gaze has real material consequences for those it identifies as deviant. For the Mariel <span class="italic">locas, </span>U.S. identification as a homosexual did not necessarily lead to exclusion, but it opened up this possibility and thereby contributed to their ambiguous standing in U.S. society. In this sense, the fractured gaze disguised the workings of state power at the level of subjectivity by constantly reiterating subject categories (criminal, homosexual, black) while allowing for fissures in its inconsistent applications. Although the worst-case scenario of the exclusion of all homosexual Mariel entrants did not materialize in this case, the state&#x2019;s refracted gaze still asserted power in its flickering recognition of supposedly negative characteristics.</p>

This quota could be exceeded by the president in consultation with Congress. The 1980 Act adopted the United Nations definition of refugee as anyone who has fled his or her country because of persecution or a &#x201C;well- founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.&#x201D; Previously, a refugee had been defined as anyone fleeing a communist country or a Middle Eastern nation. After the passage of the 1980 Refugee Act, those fleeing communist countries remained more likely to receive asylum. It soon became clear that the scale of the Mariel migration would quickly exceed the quota. A small group of early Mariel immigrants were defined as asylees, but cumbersome asylum applications and review procedures quickly proved too time-consuming. Therefore, the majority of Mariel Cubans were defined not as political refugees or asylum seekers but as economic immigrants.
