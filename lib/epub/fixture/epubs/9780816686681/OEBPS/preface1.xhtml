		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
		<h4>&#xa0;</h4>
		
		<p>THE 1980 MARIEL BOATLIFT was a turning point in Miami&#x2019;s Cuban American and gay histories. During just a few months, approximately 125,000 Cubans entered the United States in a massive and highly publicized migration that garnered national and international media attention. Among them were many homosexual men and women who migrated partly as a response to a particularly repressive era in Cuba in relation to homosexuality.</p>
		<p>During a period of tense U.S.&#x2013;Cuban relations and at the beginning of a U.S. presidential election year, a Cuban bus driver drove his bus full of passengers into the Peruvian embassy in Havana. As the driver and passengers sought and waited for asylum, Cubans around the island became increasingly restless. Many were hoping for an opening to leave the island&#x2014;after years of very limited emigration options. Others, still supportive of the regime, sought to publicly express their disdain for those wanting to leave. This started a series of events that culminated with Cuban leader Fidel Castro announcing that all Cubans wishing to leave the island would be allowed to depart&#x2014;but only through the port of Mariel. He invited Cuban Americans to come to Mariel with boats to pick up any relatives wanting to leave Cuba. When Cuban Americans arrived in the port of Mariel, they found that they were expected not only to transport the relatives they came for but also to take other Cubans who wanted to leave the island and had been given permission by the Cuban government. The day after Castro&#x2019;s invitation, the first 55 Cubans disembarked in Key West via what would eventually become a massive flotilla. The images of boats of all sizes, in various conditions, filled with Cubans of all colors and ages became media fodder. By October, 124,776 Cubans had arrived in the United States as part of Mariel.</p>
		<p>The Mariel boatlift was an immigration crisis and a public relations nightmare for both the United States and Cuba. As images of thousands of Cubans wanting to leave Cuba circulated in the international media, Castro began a disparagement campaign in which he labeled the migrants <span class="italic">escoria </span>(scum), lumpen proletariat, <span class="italic">antisociales, </span>prostitutes, and homosexuals.<sup><a id="footnote_back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> Castro argued that those who wanted to leave Cuba were simply the dregs of society who did not want to work. For U.S. president Jimmy Carter, this apparently uncontrollable migration of undesirables (during an election year) was far from ideal. To make matters worse, the Cuban government&#x2019;s insults were echoed among Miami&#x2019;s existing Cuban American population as they began noticing that the Mariel migrants were more likely to be black, poor, and less educated than previous Cuban immigrants.<sup><a id="footnote_back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>
		<p>Cubans who had immigrated to the United States since the 1960s had been depicted in fairly positive terms. According to dominant representations, they were well-educated, hardworking families and victims of communism who had become successes. Media images of white, upper-and middle-class families leaving Cuba in orderly air flights while wearing business suits and fashionable attire during the 1960s and 1970s contrasted vividly with the images of Mariel migrants overcrowded on ships, entering the United States on an apparently unstoppable flotilla. As a highly stigmatized and disparaged migration, Mariel challenged the image of Cuban American success in the U.S. national imaginary. The threat posed by &#x201C;Marielitos&#x201D; was likely evident first to Cuban Americans already living in Miami.<sup><a id="footnote_back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> After the euphoria of being reunited with relatives had passed, many Cuban Americans began noting the differences between themselves and these new migrants who, according to them, looked different, spoke Spanish differently, and suffered from having been raised under the values of a communist government. As consensus grew about the undesirability of this migrant generation, flamboyant gender-transgressive male homosexuals, or <span class="italic">locas, </span>were identified as one of the group&#x2019;s undesirable elements.</p>
		<p>I was a young girl when the Mariel boatlift happened. Just as this dramatic series of events transformed broader Miami and its Cuban American community, my own neighborhood, the southern part of Miami Beach, was equally transformed. Before Mariel, the neighborhood was known as a retirement community for mostly Jewish elderly residents who lived in low-rent and increasingly dilapidated apartment units. Although Latino families like mine were becoming a more common part of the neighborhood, Miami Beach was far from a Cuban enclave.<sup><a id="footnote_back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> After 1980 the Cuban population of Miami Beach expanded as many Mariel migrants moved to the area, attracted to the lower-priced rental apartments. During this time, the area was also known for a surge in crime rate, and it was largely considered a dangerous and unsavory place to live.</p>
		<p>Among the Mariel migrants who settled in this neighborhood were many gender-transgressive Cubans&#x2014;many of whom understood themselves to be homosexual men&#x2014;who had developed a distinctly effeminate and flamboyant style and who had come to the United States searching for the freedom to be the way they wanted to be, a freedom that continued to elude them. These visibly identifiable gay men became part of my surrounding world. They were my neighbors, students at the adult education program that shared a building with my elementary school, and fellow shoppers, pedestrians, and community members. With a distinct style that was both undeniably Cuban and unabashedly gay, this generation of Mariel gay men provided my first glimpse at gay <span class="italic">cubanidad. </span>The <span class="italic">locas </span>of this generation, or the most gender transgressive of the gay men, quickly transformed the neighborhood&#x2019;s street culture. Shortly after Mariel, it was not uncommon to see men wearing women&#x2019;s clothes during the day, something I had never before seen. I remember how &#x201C;obviously gay&#x201D; men became a regular fixture at department stores, both as clients and as employees, their mannerisms and talk marking them as other even if they did not wear women&#x2019;s attire. My grandmother, who worked at a women&#x2019;s clothing store, would regularly report that yet another man had insisted on trying on a dress in the fitting room.</p>
		<p>I use the term <span class="italic">loca </span>in the title and throughout the book to emphasize the role gender transgression played as mode of expression for Cuban and Cuban American gay men. <span class="italic">Loca </span>is a feminine-gendered noun and vernacular expression that literally translates to &#x201C;crazy woman&#x201D; and is used to denote an effeminate homosexual man. In his discussion of Dominican immigrant gay men&#x2019;s use of the term, Carlos Ulises Decena clarifies that performances of <span class="italic">la loca </span>do not reflect &#x201C;the <span class="italic">desire to be a woman </span>. . . but rather [the desire to be in] a male body that stages femininity through the deployment of stereotypes associated with women. . . . la loca operates as the symbolic other through which informants detour to inaugurate and sustain themselves.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> In other words, many homosexual men in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean understood gender transgression as a socially recognizable way to mark themselves as homosexual.<sup><a id="footnote_back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup> In the Cuban context, Carlos Paz P&#xE9;rez defines <span class="italic">loca </span>as a &#x201C;homosexual masculino muy amanerado que ostenta su condici&#xf3;n&#x201D; (a very affected male homosexual who flaunts his condition).<sup><a id="footnote_back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> Throughout this book, I highlight precisely how ostentation, flaunting, and visibility were perceived as threats to the state. As P&#xE9;rez also explains, the term can be offensive to masculine gay men because it describes the stereotype of an effeminate man.<sup><a id="footnote_back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup> While I recognize that many Cuban American gay men do not identify as <span class="italic">locas, </span>I still center the term in order to recognize how the gender-transgressive practices and their shameless deployment by some Cuban American gay men were a central component of homosexual expression. While <span class="italic">loca </span>can be used pejoratively, I hope to invoke (starting with the title of this book) the way the term is sometimes used within Cuban and Cuban American gay circles as a term of validation and identification. The <span class="italic">locas </span>who arrived as part of the Mariel boatlift were the original inspiration of this project: The men who crowded into small apartments together so they could afford the rent, who bleached their hair with peroxide and wore housedresses in the street because that was the drag they could afford, who endured the insults hurled at them because they were both Marielitos and <span class="italic">maricones, </span>presented a challenge to homogeneous images of Cubans in the United States. They challenged a young <span class="italic">cubanita </span>to rethink what it meant to be Cuban in Miami.</p>
		<p>Drawing on historical sources and ethnographic data, <span class="italic">Oye Loca </span>tells the story of the development of a Cuban American gay male culture in Miami, Florida. It examines the discourses about Mariel that both sensationalized and silenced the gay presence, the challenges faced by homosexual men who entered as part of the boatlift, and the emergent Cuban American gay culture that transformed Miami&#x2019;s ethnic and sexual landscapes. My theoretical framework critically analyzes the politics of visibility related to sexual, national, and racial/ethnic cultures. I juxtapose different kinds of visibility mediated by diverse social actors in various sociohistorical contexts: U.S. immigration officials, Cuban state authorities, gay rights activists, recently arrived immigrants, and second-generation Cuban Americans. The book&#x2019;s first part explores those events occurring before, during, and immediately after the Mariel boatlift in both Cuba and the United States that created the foundation for the demographic, political, economic, racial, and sexual changes that followed. Specifically, I examine how the Cuban and U.S. states stigmatized, identified, and tracked the movement of sexually transgressive bodies within and across their national borders and how visibility was key to both repressive and liberatory projects in Cuba and the United States. I use Mariel as way to discuss the intersection of hegemonic nationalist discourses and heterosexual masculinity, and examine the state practices that both identified homosexual men and made them disappear. In chapter 1, I juxtapose a discussion of the ways the Cuban state targeted gender-transgressive gay men in the 1960s and 1970s with an analysis of the 1977 antigay rights struggle led by Anita Bryant in South Florida, highlighting the tension between gay visibility and the silencing strategies. In chapter 2, I focus on the migration experiences of homosexual men who arrived as part of the Mariel boatlift, focusing on how the gaze of the Cuban state and U.S. state identified this population and the ways in which these identification systems intersected with state interests and desires. Chapter 3 focuses on how the Mariel migration was remembered and renarrated in subsequent decades. I analyze the intense visibility of one of the most marginal Mariel subpopulations&#x2014;gender-transgressive <span class="italic">locas </span>whose relationships with sponsors failed (&#x201C;broken sponsorship&#x201D; cases)&#x2014;tracking how public responses to their representation shifted from the 1980s to the present.</p>
		<p>This historical analysis frames the book&#x2019;s second half, an ethnographic study of contemporary Cuban American gay male culture since the 1990s. I examine the complex culture that developed among Cuban-born immigrant men and U.S.-born Cuban Americans who shared a city with other gay men from throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States. These chapters focus on the linguistic practices of Cuban American gay men (chapter 4); how gay men constructed narratives of Cuba (chapter 5); gay men&#x2019;s relationships with families of origin (chapter 6); the racialized discourses of masculinity that Cuban American gay men negotiate (chapter 7); and an analysis of Cuban American drag performances (chapter 8). By juxtaposing Cuban American gay cultures in 1980 with those in the 1990s and into the new millennium, I hope to track both the continuities and discontinuities in these gendered and racialized cultures. Central to both the continuities and discontinuities are the politics of visibility that can be linked to systematic state repression, politics of liberation, shame, and disidentification.<sup><a id="footnote_back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></p>
		
		<h3>Methods</h3>
		<p>When I started this project, my intention was to draw primarily on interviews with Cuban American gay men and participant observation of gay social centers in Miami. To that end, I lived in Miami and conducted intense participant observation between 1998&#x2013;99 and 2004&#x2013;5.<sup><a id="footnote_back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup> During these periods, I attended events throughout the city, observing gay clubs at least twice a week on average. I also collected written and promotional documents to evaluate how these events were marketed. I observed political rallies for gay rights, gay film festivals, everyday interactions in various neighborhoods, and drag performances in gay club venues, Cuban American theaters and cabaret venues, and competitive drag events.<sup><a id="footnote_back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></p>
		<p>As part of my research, I had informal conversations and formal interviews with Cuban American gay men. I conducted eighteen formal, in-depth, confidential interviews with Cuban American gay men ages twenty-two to fifty-one. During these semistructured interviews, which lasted between one and three and half hours, I spoke with men about a range of subjects including their current lives (work, social, and romantic); their relationship to Cuba and to Cuban Miami; their relationship to their families of origin; their relationship to gay life and politics; coming out; and their migration experiences, if they were not born in the United States. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, English, or a mixture of both, depending on the interviewee&#x2019;s preference. I conducted interviews at a location chosen by the respondents. Some interviews were conducted at my home; others at respondent&#x2019;s homes; some at their workplace; and some at a neutral location such as a restaurant. One was conducted over the phone. Interviews were conducted between 1995 and 1999. Although I initially planned to use snowball sampling to recruit respondents for this study, I eventually pursued a more aggressive campaign in order to interview a wider variety of men in a limited amount of time. I produced a club-card description of my research calling for interview participants and distributed this card informally through research contacts and formally through an organizational distribution list of identified Latino gay men.<sup><a id="footnote_back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> I also provided token compensation ($20) to men who agreed to be interviewed.<sup><a id="footnote_back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup></p>

Design by author and Pedro Porb&#xE9;n.</p></div></div>

		<p class="extraIndent">The men I interviewed represent a range of class, occupational, and generational perspectives. Two of the men identified their class background as upper middle class, six identified as middle class, three identified as lower middle class or working lower class. The remaining seven men identified as working class or used descriptors to refer to the difficulty of their economic situation. For example, one respondent identified his class background as &#x201C;miserable&#x201D;; another used the Cuban expression &#x201C;me estoy comiendo un cable&#x201D; in response to this question.<sup><a id="footnote_back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup> In terms of highest level of education achieved, two men interviewed had graduate or professional degrees, three had some graduate training, one had a B.A., eleven had some college, and one had a high school diploma (or equivalent). The men&#x2019;s occupations ranged from attorney, psychotherapist, and business owner to retail clerk, student, and part-time employee. Eight of the men were in their twenties at the time of the interview, four were in their thirties, and six were in their forties or early fifties. Eight of the men were born in Cuba, nine were born in the United States, and one was born in Puerto Rico.</p>		
		<p>As part of my research, I also spent time informally with a small circle of Cuban American gay men with whom I attended clubs, shared meals, and chatted regularly. All of the men were aware of my research project. One of these men played the more formal role of my research assistant. In this capacity, he reviewed my field notes of events we observed, added commentary, and discussed research implications with me. His observations were a necessary backdrop for my study, but I do not represent his observations of events as my own in what follows.</p>
		<p>Conversations with Cuban American gay men&#x2014;in the form of interviews and more casual conversations&#x2014;serve as both the foundation and the heart of this project. However, as my writing progressed, I realized that I could not fully do justice to the complexity of these men&#x2019;s lives without putting them in a larger historical and structural context and that I could not fully contextualize my analysis by drawing on interviews alone. I did not find the kind of historical analysis I was searching for in the existing literature on Cuba, Miami, and the Mariel boatlift. Therefore, I reluctantly set out to conduct some historical research myself, intending only to fill some gaps in my work. The result of that archival research can be found in the next two chapters. I was surprised at the richness and complexity of the materials I was able to find at archives and even more surprised by how seduced I became by the practice of archival research itself. In my research, I focused on the files of the Cuban&#x2013;Haitian Task Force, a federal government task force that analyzed the post-Mariel migration crisis, at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. At the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University, the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California, and the Florida Moving Images Archives, I focused on Anita Bryant&#x2019;s antigay campaign in the late 1970s as well as the role of national and local gay and lesbian organizations resisting Bryant and aiding gay immigrants from Mariel. I also collected and analyzed magazines and zines produced during my research period including two that catered specifically to Latino gay men, <span class="italic">Perra! </span>and <span class="italic">Nosotros. </span>As part of my analysis of <span class="italic">Perra! </span>I interviewed the founder and editor of the magazine, Eduardo Aparicio, on several occasions.<sup><a id="footnote_back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></p>
		<p>This project is therefore an interdisciplinary study that draws on qualitative sociological methods of interviewing and ethnography and historical methods of archival research. My goal is to provide a historically situated analysis of Cuban American gay culture that acknowledges the intersection of social hierarchies of race, gender, and sexuality.</p>
		
		<h3>Where Is Gay Miami?</h3>
		<p>As I set out to study Cuban American gay Miami, what was I studying exactly? While I am interested in Cuban American gay male <span class="italic">identity, </span>I realized early in my academic career that a focus on identity in isolation would not allow me fully to address the inequalities and geopolitical structures that limit the identities we can conjure. The concept of gay <span class="italic">community, </span>on the other hand, seemed to make connections between identities and historical/economic forces in productive ways. Scholars have identified several features of the gay community including institutional elaboration in the form of gay bars, clubs, bookstores, and so on; residential concentration; the creation and primacy of &#x201C;families we choose&#x201D;; the presence of collective political action; and a system of social support for group members.<sup><a id="footnote_back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup> John D&#x2019;Emilio and Allan B&#xE9;rub&#xE9; discuss the importance of internal migration in the development of gay communities, especially as facilitated by World War II mobilizations.<sup><a id="footnote_back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup> D&#x2019;Emilio argues that World War II &#x201C;uprooted tens of millions of American men and women, many of them young, and deposited them in a variety of nonfamilial, often sex-segregated environments,&#x201D; many of which were in &#x201C;impersonal metropolitan areas.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> This displacement produced radical shifts in American family and housing configurations and helped foster the kind of homosexual communities and cultures that now exist in San Francisco and New York City.</p>
		<p>Fifteen years after Mariel, South Beach most closely resembled this model of gay community. Although, by the 1990s, the generation of <span class="italic">locas </span>who inspired this project were less commonly seen on the streets of South Beach&#x2014;many had passed away while others had moved to more affordable neighborhoods because South Beach had morphed into one of the most desirable and increasingly expensive places to live. South Beach had become a nationally and internationally recognized destination for gay tourists and residents alike. The new gay mecca boasted an emerging arts scene and was becoming a popular location for modeling, television, and film shoots.<sup><a id="footnote_back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> Exciting dance clubs with amazing sound systems filled with &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; men, miles of beaches, and rediscovered and renovated Art Deco architecture (the aforementioned dilapidated housing of the 1980s) made the area even more attractive. Identified most strongly with gay males and commercial club locations, South Beach was labeled a decadent party town in most journalistic accounts. Throughout the 1990s South Beach was home to new gay businesses, a concentration of gay residents, and a proliferation of gay events that attracted gay men from throughout the United States.</p>
		<p>Although South Beach of the 1990s most closely fit this definition of a gay community, I did not focus exclusively on this neighborhood in this study. As the home of many Mariel gay men in the 1980s and the neighborhood most identified with gay male culture in the 1990s, South Beach rightfully appears often in this book. However, this is not the study of one clearly geographically delimited gay neighborhood or community. In my research I found that South Beach catered to particular sectors of the gay population more than others. Anglo gay men were more likely to be concentrated in South Beach than in any other Miami neighborhood in the 1990s. Cuban Americans who lived and/or socialized primarily in South Beach were also more likely to be young and U.S.-born than Cuban American gay men who lived and socialized elsewhere. Because South Beach is increasingly gentrified, gay men who are poorer and more transgressive find it more and more difficult to afford rents. Also, in my study I interviewed many gay men who either lived with or near their biological families. These men were more likely to live in predominantly Latino areas of the city such as Southwest Miami and Hialeah. I also found that Latino gay venues outside South Beach differed markedly from those in or near South Beach. For example, South Beach venues that regularly catered to Latino gay men and several venues hosting weekly Latino parties were located in areas of gay business and residential concentration, and Latinos who attended these events tended to be young and conformed to the dominant model of gay masculinity. In contrast, gay social centers catering to Latino gay men in mainland Miami were attended by men of more diverse ages and body types and were not part of a geographically based community but instead were situated in isolated locations (e.g., a warehouse district in a commercial area by the Miami River) or simply not near a concentration of businesses catering to gay men.</p>
		<p>To be clear, a study of South Beach&#x2019;s gay community would not have excluded Cuban Americans entirely. Many Cuban American gay men lived, shopped, or socialized in the area, and Latino gay men are often cited as part of the attraction of South Beach as a gay mecca. However, a study of South Beach&#x2019;s gay community would have provided a highly selective view of Cuban American gay life, at best. A focus on Miami&#x2019;s gay community, narrowly defined, would therefore emphasize the experience of Anglo gay men and a particular subgroup of Cuban American gay men&#x2014;the most economically privileged, the young and attractive.</p>
		<p>For these reasons, this is not a study of gay <span class="italic">community </span>as defined above but rather a study of Cuban American gay <span class="italic">culture. </span>I define culture as the complex interrelationships among lived practices, self-identifications, social institutions, produced texts, and a more ephemeral form of cohesion Raymond Williams called a structure of feeling.<sup><a id="footnote_back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> By this definition that is deeply inspired by the Birmingham School of cultural studies, culture includes consciously produced actions and words as well as less-articulated ways of being. By focusing on culture, I am able to target particular ethnic/racial groups (in this case, Cuban Americans) whose formations around sexuality may or may not take the cohesive, institutional, and territorial forms of gay community that sociologists have identified. This definition of culture points to the contradictory strands, the heterogeneity, and the shifting and contextual nature of what I am calling Cuban American gay male culture. By this definition, culture is not singular, homogeneous, or self-contained. Under this rubric, I address complex interrelationships within an individual&#x2019;s life (e.g., tensions between self-identification and lived practices) as well as the dense network formed by people who were born in or trace their descent to Cuba, who understand themselves as men, who understand their desire for men as part of their identity, and who live in South Florida, but who might be quite different in other ways. I understand culture to be structurally constrained but not structurally determined. This approach insists on an analysis that is socio-historically specific in order to analyze what Antonio Gramsci would call &#x201C;conjuncture.&#x201D; It highlights both structural forces that constrain our actions and identities, and people&#x2019;s creative work to make meaning of their own lives and their social context within these constraints. As my work demonstrates, this creative work is not necessarily resistant or regressive. For example, sometimes this meaning-making leads to the reinforcement of racial privilege; other times it can challenge existing racist assumptions; and sometimes it can do both simultaneously. I contrast this definition of culture with culturalist analyses of Latino lives that see &#x201C;Latino culture&#x201D; as ahistorically static, traditional, and homogeneous.<sup><a id="footnote_back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">21</a></sup> I purposefully center the heterogeneity of Cuban American gay male culture. Therefore, this study includes U.S.-born and foreign-born men; men of different social classes and occupational groups; gay men who see themselves as very masculine and are proud of how they can pass as straight and gay men who believe their gayness is utterly obvious; men who are upwardly mobile professionals and men who are unemployed; men who speak only Spanish, men who speak only English, and bilingual (and multilingual) men; those who understand themselves as unquestionably white and racially unmarked and those who understand themselves to be racialized in particular ways; those who lived in Miami&#x2019;s quintessential gay neighborhood of South Beach, those who lived in its quintessential Cuban neighborhood of <span class="italic">la sag&#xFC;esera </span>(of Southwest Miami), and those who lived in the very Latinized suburb of Kendall.</p>
		<p>The participants of this Cuban American gay culture lead quite different day-to-day lives that may cross occasionally, often, or not at all. In this diverse culture, similar lived practices can occur under radically different conditions to produce different effects. For example, among my interview participants, it was fairly common for Cuban American gay men to have extensive relationships with biological family, and it was not uncommon for men to live with biological family (a topic I explore in chapter 6). However, this cohabitation is experienced quite differently by an economically independent U.S.-born man who might temporarily live with a family member in need of caretaking than it is by a recent Cuban immigrant who is unemployed, does not speak English, and out of necessity lives with a homophobic relative.</p>
		
		<h3>Migrations</h3>
		<p>As mentioned previously, some sociological and historical accounts of gay community did center the importance of migrations&#x2014;mostly domestic or internal migrations of Anglo men to urban centers. Tom&#225;s Almaguer has argued that white, middle-class gay men had more access to these gay communities than other groups:</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>It is very apparent . . . that the gay identity and communities that emerged [in the United States] were overwhelmingly white, middle class, and male-centered. . . . Moreover, the new communities founded in the postwar period were largely populated by white men who had the resources and talents needed to create &#x201C;gilded&#x201D; gay ghettoes. This fact has given the contemporary gay community&#x2014;despite its undeniable diversity&#x2014;a largely white, middle-class, and male form. . . . [White men&#x2019;s] collective position in the social structure empowered them with the skills and talents needed to create new gay institutions, communities, and a unique sexual subculture.<sup><a id="footnote_back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">22</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>Almaguer raises an important point: not everyone could afford <span class="italic">that kind </span>of migration. On the other hand, international migration, between Latin America and the United States, structures many (but not all) Latino gay men&#x2019;s lives. Recent scholarship by Lionel Cant&#xfa; Jr., Eithne Luibh&#xE9;id, Carlos Decena, Martin Manalansan IV, Arnaldo Cruz-Malav&#xE9;, Gloria Gonz&#225;lez-L&#xf3;pez, and H&#xE9;ctor Carrillo has helped us theorize the relationship between sexuality and international migration.<sup><a id="footnote_back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">23</a></sup> In his work on Mexican immigrant men who have sex with men, Cant&#xfa; analyzes the &#x201C;queer political economy of migration.&#x201D; Like Cant&#xfa;, I hope not only to shed light on a particular gay population but to examine sexuality as an &#x201C;axis of power relations,&#x201D; in order to make &#x201C; &#x2019;regimes of normalization&#x2019; visible.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">24</a></sup> Cant&#xfa;&#x2019;s critique of culturalist paradigms and focus on political economy provides a useful guide for my study of Cuban American gay male culture.</p>
		<p>The migration that has affected my respondents most directly is the migration from Cuba to the United States&#x2014;either their own or that of their parents and/or grandparents. The dynamics of this migration, especially in that it has tended to keep biological families together, as opposed to separating young men and women from the strictures of family control, has direct effects on the configurations of gay life. Thus the particular case of Miami helps us distinguish what characteristics are common to gay communities and what characteristics are more specific to particular race and class communities.</p>
		
		<h3>Miami&#x2019;s Racial Landscape</h3>
		<p>Miami is undeniably a Latino and Caribbean city. Labeled as the gateway to the Americas, it is an entry point of Latin American and Caribbean capital, immigrants, tourists, and media into the United States. In 1990, 49.2 percent of Miami&#x2013;Dade County&#x2019;s population identified as Hispanic; by 2000, a majority (57 percent) identified as Hispanic, and by 2010, 65 percent identified as Hispanic.<sup><a id="footnote_back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">25</a></sup> White non-Hispanics (20.7 percent in 2000, 15.9 percent in 2010) and black non-Hispanics (19 percent in 2000, 17.6 percent in 2010) made up the declining portions of the area&#x2019;s population.<sup><a id="footnote_back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">26</a></sup> In the new millennium, Miami&#x2013;Dade County was also home to an increasingly diverse Latino population including Cubans (50.4 percent of all Hispanics in 2000 and 52.7 percent in 2010), Puerto Ricans (6.2 percent in 2000, 5.7 percent in 2010), Nicaraguans (5.4 percent in 2000, 6.5 percent in 2010), Colombians (5.4 percent in 2000, 7 percent in 2010), Dominicans (2.8 percent in 2000, 3.6 percent in 2010), and Mexicans (2.9 percent in 2000, 3.2 percent in 2010).<sup><a id="footnote_back27"></a><a href="#footnote27">27</a></sup> Although Miami&#x2019;s Latino population is far from homogeneous, Cuban Americans form Miami&#x2019;s largest Hispanic national origin group, and they exert political, social, and economic influence in most realms of urban life.</p>
		<p>Although Cubans had been living in South Florida before 1959, they began arriving in large numbers after Castro&#x2019;s entry to power at the end of that year. During the first years of Cuban mass migration to the United States (1959&#x2013;65), close to 300,000 Cubans entered the United States. After the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, the migration slowed substantially as flights between Cuba and the United States were canceled; however, Cubans continued to enter the United States through third countries. In 1965 large-scale migration from Cuba to the United States resumed. In what would become a preview of the Mariel boat-lift, in 1965 Castro invited Cuban Americans to come in boats to pick up their relatives from Camarioca harbor. As five thousand Cubans entered the United States in the boatlift, the two countries signed an agreement permitting commercial flights between Havana and Miami. In the United States, the migration of Cubans through this air bridge became known as the Freedom Flights. Between 1965 and 1973 (when Castro terminated the flights), more than 340,000 Cubans entered the United States. The period between 1973 and 1980 constituted another slow period of Cuban migration: only 24,000 Cubans entered the United States either by leaving Cuba clandestinely or by entering the United States through a third country.<sup><a id="footnote_back28"></a><a href="#footnote28">28</a></sup></p>
		<p>During the 1960s and 1970s Cuban immigrants were generally portrayed as desirable immigrants fleeing Castro&#x2019;s regime for political reasons. The Cubans who came to the United States in the year or two after the revolution have been called the &#x201C;golden exiles&#x201D; and characterized as the elites of Cuban society. Generally, they were professionals, business owners, and landowners with ties to U.S. business and/or the previous Cuban regime of Fulgencio Batista who were alienated from the revolution during the first phases of the nationalization process. Between 1960 and 1962, middle-class entrepreneurs became part of the migrant flow when rental property began to be confiscated in Cuba. Some scholars have argued that the elite nature of these immigrants has been overstated. Thomas D. Boswell and James R. Curtis argue that although early (1959&#x2013;62) Cuban immigrants were not representative of the Cuban population, they were not homogeneously elite either. According to Boswell and Curtis, only 40 percent of this migration might be considered elite. The other 60 percent consisted mostly of clerical and sales workers (31 percent) and skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers (20 percent).<sup><a id="footnote_back29"></a><a href="#footnote29">29</a></sup> The immigrants who arrived in the United States via the Freedom Flights consisted of different segments of Cuban society: close to half the immigrants were blue-collar (skilled and unskilled) workers, while some 10 percent were agricultural workers and fishermen.<sup><a id="footnote_back30"></a><a href="#footnote30">30</a></sup> Sheila L. Croucher comments:</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>Much of the public discourse on Cuban immigration, whether it emanates from the immigrants themselves or from the society at large, paints a portrait of Cubans in the United States as an economically powerful, politically united, and culturally homogenous ethnic group. Neither this image nor many of the assumptions upon which it is based is well grounded in empirical reality.<sup><a id="footnote_back31"></a><a href="#footnote31">31</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>Although the demographic profiles of these waves of migration are diverse and indicate that the elite nature of migrants declined greatly in more recent migrations, throughout the 1960s and 1970s the portrait of the white, well-educated, elite, hardworking, model minority Cuban family became increasingly popular in the U.S. media and among Cubans themselves.</p>
		<p>Unlike other Hispanic groups in the United States who have been identified as nonwhite in the regions of their settlement, Cuban Americans who arrived between 1959 and 1980 were generally racialized as white in the context of South Florida. Benigno Aguirre outlines a set of reasons explaining the disproportionate racial distribution of Cuban migration. The early mass migration was attractive to the elites of Cuban society. Because Cuba was a racially stratified society where blacks were less likely to be elites than whites, the majority of early migrants (post-1959) were white by Cuban standards. The ensuing chain migrations along with the U.S. family reunification policy that privileged migrants who already had relatives in the United States further excluded black Cubans. In addition, the Cuban Revolution targeted racism and promised a society free of racial discrimination. This ideology, along with real improvements in the position of blacks in some areas of Cuban society, made staying in Cuba more attractive to black Cubans, especially prior to 1980.<sup><a id="footnote_back32"></a><a href="#footnote32">32</a></sup> Therefore, there are a series of reasons why those considered white in Cuba were more likely to migrate to the United States. However, as the history of Latino immigration to the United States teaches us, white racial status in Latin America does not necessarily translate to white racial status in the United States after immigration. Nevertheless, Cuban Americans in South Florida in many ways achieved white racial status. This significant difference with other U.S. Latino/a groups can be attributed to a range of factors including class, racial, and phenotypical characteristics of the first massive wave of Cuban immigrants; the ties to U.S. businesses many immigrants had before migration; the fairly welcoming stance of the U.S. government; the economic support provided by the Cuban Refugee Program; and the subsequent socioeconomic position of many Cuban Americans.<sup><a id="footnote_back33"></a><a href="#footnote33">33</a></sup></p>
		<p>Cuban American definitions of whiteness are greatly influenced by Cuban racial categories. After the virtual elimination of Cuba&#x2019;s indigenous population through violence, displacement, illness, and suicide, African slaves became the primary source of labor on the island.<sup><a id="footnote_back34"></a><a href="#footnote34">34</a></sup> The history of black&#x2013;white relations on the island are complex. On the one hand, Cuba &#x201C;received African slaves into the 1860s and was the last Spanish colony to abolish slavery (1886).&#x201D; On the other hand, in the 1800s a sizable population of free blacks lived on the island, universal male suffrage was granted by the 1901 constitutional convention (women gained the right to vote in 1934), and the first &#x201C;racially defined national political party&#x201D; was organized by blacks in 1912.<sup><a id="footnote_back35"></a><a href="#footnote35">35</a></sup></p>
		<p>Especially after the success of the Haitian Revolution, Cuban elites developed an ostensibly inclusive discourse of the nation that at least symbolically incorporated blacks with the hopes of avoiding a black uprising. As Alejandro de la Fuente explains,</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>the nationalist ideology envisioned a new republic that would be not only politically independent but egalitarian and inclusive as well&#x2014;a republic &#x201C;with all and for all,&#x201D; as Jos&#xE9; Mart&#xED; had called it. The existence of &#x201C;races&#x201D; was seen as a social reality, but within an encompassing notion of Cuban-ness that was supposed to subsume, and eventually erase, racial identities.<sup><a id="footnote_back36"></a><a href="#footnote36">36</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>Since then, ideologies of a racially inclusive Cuba have coexisted with racial discrimination and chronic (if not unchanging) patterns of racial inequality in radically different state contexts. Fuente has argued that a discourse of mixed-race origins of the Cuban nation actually served to silence issues of race:</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>The very governments that have pledged allegiance to the ideal of a racially integrated nation, as they all have done since the early republic, also have implemented policies that resulted in the survival and reproduction of socially constructed perceptions of race.<sup><a id="footnote_back37"></a><a href="#footnote37">37</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>In Cuba an ideology of racial inclusiveness, a reluctance to discuss contemporary racism, and a persistence of racial inequality have coexisted before and after the Cuban Revolution.</p>
		<p>The definitions of racial categories themselves also responded to the demographic changes in Cuba and the specter of the Haitian Revolution. As Mirta de la Torre Mulhare explains, when faced with a disproportionate increase in the black population, Cuban elites increased &#x201C;the ranks of the whites through the gradual acceptance of part-whites as whites.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back38"></a><a href="#footnote38">38</a></sup> In contrast, faced with a similar demographic shift, elites in the U.S. South defined anyone with &#x201C;one drop&#x201D; of black blood as black.<sup><a id="footnote_back39"></a><a href="#footnote39">39</a></sup> Silvia Pedraza-Bailey highlights the extent to which definitions of racial categories in Cuba were related to class: &#x201C;Social class and race overlapped in the extreme. So that Cubans valued whiteness as tantamount to beauty, status, and honor. Contrary to American practice, color gradations had meaning particularly when buttressed by income and authority.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back40"></a><a href="#footnote40">40</a></sup> Mulhare also comments on the &#x201C;defensiveness&#x201D; of Cubans about their own racial composition. A doctor she interviewed shed further light on this phenomenon:</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>If they were not so afraid of having black blood themselves, they would not talk so much of their whiteness. It is nothing but hypocrisy. They pretend as if they do not see color if it is light enough or if the black relatives are hidden, and they see it only when it is very dark or very poor.<sup><a id="footnote_back41"></a><a href="#footnote41">41</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p class="extraIndent">The mass migration of elite Cubans to Miami, a city dominated by the black&#x2013;white U.S. binary, did not allow for the acknowledgment of racial gradations, but it did foster the strategic employment and further redefinition of Cuban whiteness. Miami bears the scars of being a Southern city. These scars mark a clear racial segregation that separates dark-skinned Miamians from light-skinned Miamians. Miami&#x2019;s African Americans, Haitian Americans, and Bahamian Americans, as well as dark-skinned Latinos, are defined as black.<sup><a id="footnote_back42"></a><a href="#footnote42">42</a></sup> Both Anglos and light-skinned Latinos are defined as white. In addition, the vast majority of Latinos in Miami do not self-identify as black. For example, in 1990, 2000, and 2010, only 2 to 3 percent of Miami&#x2013;Dade Hispanics identified as black.<sup><a id="footnote_back43"></a><a href="#footnote43">43</a></sup></p>
		<p>The 1980 Mariel migration challenged the image of Cuban success and Cuban whiteness. Various stigmas were associated with the boat-lift. According to popular representations, Marielitos were criminals, prostitutes, mental patients, and homosexuals. The Marielitos also were more likely to be dark skinned, which posed a challenge to Cuban American claims to whiteness.<sup><a id="footnote_back44"></a><a href="#footnote44">44</a></sup> In other words, the same migration that was stigmatized in terms of sexuality was also stigmatized because of its racial composition. Given this racial context, this study examines the racialization of Cuban American gay men. In chapter 5, I describe how narratives of Cuba are central to understanding Cuban American gay men&#x2019;s ethnic identities. I explore how Cuban American gay men negotiate racial boundaries of exclusion through these narratives. In chapters 7 and 8, I explore the racialized meanings of masculinity that Cuban American gay men contend with in the development of their gender and sexual identities. I argue that although the Cuban American gay men I interviewed reject the notion of themselves as nonwhite, they nonetheless describe a distance between themselves and those masculinities identified with white gay men. Throughout the book I counter pose men&#x2019;s apparently transparent white self-identifications with evidence of a different racialization that is not necessarily articulated in the language of race.</p>
		
		<h3>A Focus on Men</h3>
		<p>One central concern of this book is the apparent contradiction between the visibility of gay men in Cuban culture and their simultaneous invisibility. I trace the tension between visibility and silence, beginning with an analysis of events surrounding the Mariel boatlift. This dialectic between visibility and silence is particular to Cuban American gay men and quite different from the ways in which Cuban and Cuban American lesbians are interpellated (or not) by the state and in popular culture. For example, as I discuss in chapter 1, the Cuban state explicitly targeted homosexual men and articulated a discourse that identified male homosexuality as a product of bourgeois capitalist decadence. Although Cuban lesbians, masculine women, and women who had sex with women were not free from persecution, they were not visible to or identified by the state in the same way as gay men. The intense focus of the state gaze on gender-transgressive male homosexuals, in particular, and the public discourse against effeminacy and male homosexuality were explicitly tied to an emerging national discourse about a virile new Cuban nation and society. In other cultural realms, there are similar differences between gay men and lesbians. Whereas Cuban American gay men are often vilified in Cuban jokes, mocked in Spanish-language soap operas, and identified with visible gender transgressors (effeminate gay men), Cuban American lesbians are hardly represented at all. In addition, whereas Cuban American gay men participate in public and commercial gay male cultures, Cuban American lesbians are more likely to congregate in private settings like house parties. Gay commercial venues in Miami cater predominantly to men and are highly gender segregated. Lesbians of all races have only begun to claim these commercial spaces as their own, usually through new theme nights specifically geared toward lesbians. Although there are exceptions, I did not find that Cuban American gay men and lesbians interacted extensively with one another as groups.</p>
		<p>In short, I would argue that whereas homosexual men in both Cuban and Cuban American contexts have to contend with a stigmatizing hypervisibility, lesbians in these same contexts have had to face cultural unintelligibility. Given these differences, a study of Cuban American lesbians would require a different kind of ethnography centered on a different set of questions. This is, therefore, a study of Cuban American gay male culture and not lesbian culture.<sup><a id="footnote_back45"></a><a href="#footnote45">45</a></sup> That being said, my research on the race, sexuality, and gender of a group of men has been guided by the transformative work of queer Latina feminists. In her call to bring Chicano gay men into a discussion of Queer Aztl&#225;n, Cherr&#xED;e Moraga provides a model for a feminist engagement with queer masculinity&#x2014;one that embraces gay men of color&#x2019;s marginality while never justifying patriarchy.<sup><a id="footnote_back46"></a><a href="#footnote46">46</a></sup> As I have argued elsewhere, empirical social science research on Latina lesbians is quite limited, but I hope my study will inspire future researchers to explore Latina lesbian sexuality and culture on their own terms.<sup><a id="footnote_back47"></a><a href="#footnote47">47</a></sup> In particular, my study questions how masculine privilege intersects with gay sexuality. Regarding women who are not raised with the freedom of movement, respect, and authority given to Cuban American men, I would ask, how do they negotiate relationships with biological family? Given that Latina lesbians (at least in Miami) do not inhabit commercial venues organized around sexuality to the same extent men do, what kinds of social spaces are central to their lives, identities, and cultures? How have interventions by medical institutions affected Cuban and Cuban American lesbians? What are the challenges and possibilities posed by lesbian invisibility in regard to the state and popular culture?</p>
		
		<h3>Rastros</h3>
		<p>During one of my interviews with Eduardo Aparicio, editor of <span class="italic">Perra!, </span>I asked him if he saw the publication as a way to create or develop a Latino gay community. He responded:</p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>Mi postura siempre es que esa comunidad existe, solamente que no hay evidencia de esa comunidad. Entonce era m&#225;s bien para evidenciar esa comunidad. Ver lo que est&#225;n haciendo Juan y Pedro en su casa y cuando limpian, [simplemente] lo mas ordinario, lo que hacen para cocinar, o que hicieron hoy, o c&#xf3;mo se conocieron, &#xbf;no? Esa comunidad existe. Lo que no exist&#xED;a era alg&#xfa;n tipo de evidencia escrita, palpable, que pod&#xED;as tener en tus manos.</p>
		<p class="noIndent spaceAbove">My position has always been that this community already exists. There simply isn&#x2019;t any evidence of that community. Therefore, the point of <span class="italic">[Perra!] </span>was to provide evidence of that community. To see what Juan and Pedro were doing in their house, when they&#x2019;re cleaning, [simply] the most ordinary things, how they cook, or what they did today, or how they met. That community exists, what didn&#x2019;t exist was any type of written, palpable evidence of it that you could hold in your hands.<sup><a id="footnote_back48"></a><a href="#footnote48">48</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>Aparicio begins his answer with a claim&#x2014;a claim of the existence of gay Latino community. He knows this community exists because he is a member of it, because he has participated in it, because he has seen it. If the gay Latino community is so visible and so present, then how can it also be true that there is no material evidence of it? Why would the evidence be so fleeting as to lead Aparicio to remark that it is not &#x201C;palpable&#x201D;?</p>
		<p>In contrast to nonpalpable evidence, Aparicio wanted to produce something that would be palpable and that would leave &#x201C;un rastro&#x201D; (a trace), as he told me. He wanted to produce something that would exist in the physical world after its moment of production (something &#x201C;you could hold in your hands&#x201D;). The importance of the lasting physicality of the &#x201C;rastro&#x201D; became clear when we talked about drag shows. I mentioned that drag shows were another site where I saw evidence of a Latino gay community. Although he agreed with this, he did not believe a drag show left any lasting evidence of its existence: &#x201C;&#xbf;El show que se hizo en septiembre del 96, d&#xf3;nde est&#225; ese show, d&#xf3;nde qued&#xf3;?&#x201D; (The show that was performed in September of 96, where is it? Where did it end up?). On the other hand, a magazine produced in September 1996 could be right here, in my hands, providing physical, undeniable proof of its existence, leaving <span class="italic">un rastro.</span><sup><a id="footnote_back49"></a><a href="#footnote49">49</a></sup></p>
		<p>As a social analyst, I was very appreciative of having the material evidence produced by Aparicio, evidence that I could hold in my hand (and photocopy, code, and manipulate in other sociological ways). However, not all <span class="italic">rastros </span>of Cuban American gay culture were this material in their form. From my incipient interest in gay Mariel, I knew I would have to develop ways to investigate what was made invisible, what undeniably existed but was evidenced only by a fleeting visibility.</p>
		<p>In <span class="italic">Ghostly Matters, </span>Avery Gordon discusses the sociology of haunting as a theoretical framework for grasping the effects of the unseen, invisible, and hidden in our social world.<sup><a id="footnote_back50"></a><a href="#footnote50">50</a></sup> She draws on Raymond Williams&#x2019;s concept of structures of feeling. Williams argues that these less-articulated ways of being are a central part of any culture under study, yet they are not usually the object of social analysis. They are often misclassified as whimsical, personal, unimportant, or mystical. Williams insists that structures of feelings &#x201C;do not have to await definition, classification, or rationalization before they exert <span class="italic">palpable </span>pressures and set effective limits on experience and on action.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back51"></a><a href="#footnote51">51</a></sup> Therefore, he challenges social analysts to expand our methodological tools as well as to expand our definition of the social in order to understand the determinants of our social world. Williams argues that nonmaterial <span class="italic">rastros </span>also have palpable effects. Gordon puts it another way: the &#x201C;ghosts are real . . . [and] they produce material effects.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back52"></a><a href="#footnote52">52</a></sup></p>
		<p>Why should we study, analyze, write about structures of feelings that are not clear or fully visible? Why not stick to what we can see clearly? The answer is that, as social analysts, what we see and how we see are deeply embedded in power hierarchies. There are those who have been systematically excluded from scholarly texts. The ostentatious Mariel <span class="italic">locas </span>who everybody saw but no one was willing to recognize as legitimate subjects form the most obvious example of this paradox. As we try to write &#x201C;histories of the present&#x201D; that confront the structures that silence, we challenge ourselves to articulate what is on the &#x201C;edge of semantic availability.&#x201D;<sup><a id="footnote_back53"></a><a href="#footnote53">53</a></sup></p>
		
      <div class="blockquote">
		<p>Perceiving the lost subjects of history&#x2014;the missing and the lost ones and the blind fields they inhabit&#x2014;makes all the difference to any project trying to find the address of the present. . . . To write the history of the present requires stretching toward the horizon of what cannot be seen with ordinary clarity yet. And to stretch toward and beyond a horizon requires a particular kind of perception where the transparent and the shadowy confront each other. As an ethnographic project to write the history of the present requires grappling with the form ideological interpellation takes&#x2014;&#x201C;we have <span class="italic">already </span>understood&#x201D;&#x2014;and with the difficulty of imagining beyond the limits of what is already <span class="italic">understandable.</span><sup><a id="footnote_back54"></a><a href="#footnote54">54</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      
		<p>In this ethnography of Cuban American gay culture, I have tried to be cognizant of the &#x201C;lost subjects of history&#x201D; that &#x201C;haunt&#x201D; the clubs I attended, the stories I heard, and the newspaper articles I read. By juxtaposing a transnational historical context and men&#x2019;s self-articulations, lived practices, and social context, I hope to track not only what is said but also what is not said (or silenced) and to be able to analyze not only what is hypervisible but also fleeting visibilities. I hope that my presentation of the <span class="italic">rastros </span>of Cuban American gay male culture does justice to the challenges, joys, and complexities of these men&#x2019;s lives.</p>
